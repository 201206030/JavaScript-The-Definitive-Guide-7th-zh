<p>Some datatypes, such as numbers and strings (Chapter 3), objects (Chapter 6), and arrays (Chapter 7) are so fundamental to JavaScript that we can consider them to be part of the language itself. This chapter covers other important but less fundamental APIs that can be thought of as defining the “standard library” for JavaScript: these are useful classes and functions that are built in to JavaScript and available to all JavaScript programs in both web browsers and in Node.<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<blockquote>
<p>一些数据类型，如数字和字符串（第 3 章）、对象（第 6 章）和数组（第 7 章）是 JavaScript 的基础，我们可以将它们视为语言本身的一部分。这一章涵盖了其他重要但不那么基础的 api，这些 api 可以被认为是定义 JavaScript 的“标准库”：这些是 JavaScript 内建的有用的类和函数，在 web 浏览器和 Node 中的所有 JavaScript 程序中都可以使用。 [<sup>1]</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The sections of this chapter are independent of one another, and you can read them in any order. They cover:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>本章的各个章节是相互独立的，你可以以任何顺序阅读它们。他们包括:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Set and Map classes for representing sets of values and mappings from one set of values to another set of values.</li>
<li>Array-like objects known as TypedArrays that represent arrays of binary data, along with a related class for extracting values from non-array binary data.</li>
<li>Regular expressions and the RegExp class, which define textual patterns and are useful for text processing. This section also covers regular expression syntax in detail.</li>
<li>The Date class for representing and manipulating dates and times.</li>

<p>Some of the sections in this chapter—notably, the sections on typed arrays and regular expressions—are quite long because there is significant background information you need to understand before you can use those types effectively. Many of the other sections, however, are short: they simply introduce a new API and show some examples of its use.</p>

<blockquote>

<h2 id="toc_0">11.1 Sets and Maps</h2>

<p>JavaScript’s Object type is a versatile data structure that can be used to map strings (the object’s property names) to arbitrary values. And when the value being mapped to is something fixed like true, then the object is effectively a set of strings.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>JavaScript 的对象类型是一种通用的数据结构，可用于将字符串（对象的属性名称）映射到任意值。当被映射到的值是固定的，比如 true，那么对象实际上是一组字符串。</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Objects are actually used as maps and sets fairly routinely in JavaScript programming, but this is limited by the restriction to strings and complicated by the fact that objects normally inherit properties with names like “toString”, which are not typically intended to be part of the map or set.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>在 JavaScript 编程中，对象通常被用作映射和集合，但这受到字符串的限制，而且由于对象通常继承诸如“toString”之类的属性而变得复杂，这些属性通常不准备成为映射或集合的一部分。</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For this reason, ES6 introduces true Set and Map classes, which we’ll cover in the sub-sections that follow.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>因此，ES6引入了 true Set 和 Map 类，我们将在后面的子节中介绍它们。</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="toc_1">11.1.1 The Set Class</h3>

<p>A set is a collection of values, like an array is. Unlike arrays, however, sets are not ordered or indexed, and they do not allow duplicates: a value is either a member of a set or it is not a member; it is not possible to ask how many times a value appears in a set.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>set 是值的集合，就像数组。但不同于数组，set 没有被排序或被索引，并且它们不允许重复：值要么是集合的成员要么不是集合的成员；不能知道一个值在集合中出现多少次。</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Create a Set object with the Set() constructor:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>使用 Set() 创建 Set 对象：</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">let s = new Set();       // A new, empty set
let t = new Set([1, s]); // A new set with two members
</code></pre>

<p>The argument to the Set() constructor need not be an array: any iterable object (including other Set objects) is allowed:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Set() 构造函数的实参不必是数组：允许任何可迭代的对象（包括其他 Set 对象）：</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">let t = new Set(s);                  // A new set that copies the elements of s.
let unique = new Set(&quot;Mississippi&quot;); // 4 elements: &quot;M&quot;, &quot;i&quot;, &quot;s&quot;, and &quot;p&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>The size property of a set is like the length property of an array: it tells you how many values the set contains:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>set 的 size 属性类似于数组的 length 属性：它告诉你该集合包含多少个值：</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">unique.size        // =&gt; 4
</code></pre>

<p>Sets don’t need to be initialized when you create them. You can add and remove elements at any time with add(), delete(), and clear(). Remember that sets cannot contain duplicates, so adding a value to a set when it already contains that value has no effect:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>创建 set 时无需初始化。可以随时使用add()、delete() 和 clear() 添加和删除元素。请记住，集合不能包含重复项，因此添加已经包含在该 set 中的值是一个无效操作：</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">let s = new Set();  // Start empty
s.size              // =&gt; 0
s.add(1);           // Add a number
s.size              // =&gt; 1; now the set has one member
s.add(1);           // Add the same number again
s.size              // =&gt; 1; the size does not change
s.add(true);        // Add another value; note that it is fine to mix types
s.size              // =&gt; 2
s.add([1,2,3]);     // Add an array value
s.size              // =&gt; 3; the array was added, not its elements
s.delete(1)         // =&gt; true: successfully deleted element 1
s.size              // =&gt; 2: the size is back down to 2
s.delete(&quot;test&quot;)    // =&gt; false: &quot;test&quot; was not a member, deletion failed
s.delete(true)      // =&gt; true: delete succeeded
s.delete([1,2,3])   // =&gt; false: the array in the set is different
s.size              // =&gt; 1: there is still that one array in the set
s.clear();          // Remove everything from the set
s.size              // =&gt; 0
</code></pre>

<p>There are a few important points to note about this code:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>关于此代码，有几点要注意：</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The add() method takes a single argument; if you pass an array, it adds the array itself to the set, not the individual array elements. add() always returns the set it is invoked on, however, so if you want to add multiple values to a set, you can used chained method calls like s.add(&#39;a&#39;).add(&#39;b&#39;).add(&#39;c&#39;);.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>add() 方法有一个实参。如果传递数组，它将数组本身而不是单个数组元素添加到 set 中。 add() 始终返回调用它的 set，因此，如果要向 set 添加多个值，则可以使用方法链调用，如s.add(&#39;a&#39;).add(&#39;b&#39;).add(&#39;C&#39;);。</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The delete() method also only deletes a single set element at a time. Unlike add(), however, delete() returns a boolean value. If the value you specify was actually a member of the set, then delete() removes it and returns true. Otherwise, it does nothing and returns false.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>delete() 方法一次也只删除一个 set 元素。与 add() 不同，delete() 返回一个布尔值。如果指定的值是 set 的成员，则 delete() 会将其删除并返回 true。否则，它不执行任何操作并返回 false。</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Finally, it is very important to understand that set membership is based on strict equality checks, like the === operator performs. A set can contain both the number 1 and the string &quot;1&quot;, because it considers them to be distinct values. When the values are objects (or arrays or functions), they are also compared as if with ===. This is why we were unable to delete the array element from the set in this code. We added an array to the set and then tried to remove that array by passing a different array (albeit with the same elements) to the delete() method. In order for this to work, we would have had to pass a reference to exactly the same array.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>最后，set 成员关系是基于严格的相等性检查（如 === 运算符执行），这是非常重要的。一个 set 可以同时包含数字 1 和字符串 &quot;1&quot;，因为它认为它们是不同的值。当值是对象（或数组或函数）时，它们也将用 === 进行比较。这就是此代码集中为什么我们无法从删除数组元素的原因。我们向 set 中添加了一个数组，然后尝试通过将另一个数组（尽管具有相同的元素）传递给 delete() 方法来删除该数组。为了使它起作用，我们必须传递完全相同的数组引用。</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="toc_2">NOTE</h4>

<p>Python programmers take note: this is a significant difference between JavaScript and Python sets. Python sets compare members for equality, not identity, but the trade-off is that Python sets only allow immutable members, like tuples, and do not allow lists and dicts to be added to sets.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Python 程序员请注意：JavaScript 和 Python 的 set 之间有个很大的差异。 Python set 比较成员是为了相等，而不是标识，但是要权衡的是 Python set 只允许不可变成员（例如元组），并且不允许将 list 和 dict 添加到集合中。（todo）</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In practice, the most important thing we do with sets is not to add and remove elements from them, but to check to see whether a specified value is a member of the set. We do this with the has() method:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>实际上，我们对 set 进行的最重要的操作不是在元素中添加和删除元素，而是检查指定的值是否是集合的成员。我们使用 has() 方法做到这一点：</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">let oneDigitPrimes = new Set([2,3,5,7]);
oneDigitPrimes.has(2)    // =&gt; true: 2 is a one-digit prime number
oneDigitPrimes.has(3)    // =&gt; true: so is 3
oneDigitPrimes.has(4)    // =&gt; false: 4 is not a prime
oneDigitPrimes.has(&quot;5&quot;)  // =&gt; false: &quot;5&quot; is not even a number
</code></pre>

<p>The most important thing to understand about sets is that they are optimized for membership testing, and no matter how many members the set has, the has() method will be very fast. The includes() method of an array also performs membership testing, but the time it takes is proportional to the size of the array, and using an array as a set can be much, much slower than using a real Set object.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>关于 set 最重要的要了解的是，它们已针对成员资格测试进行了优化，并且无论 set 有多少个成员，has() 方法都将非常快。 数组的 includes() 方法也执行成员资格测试，但是花费的时间与数组的大小成正比，并且将数组作为 set 使用比使用真正的 Set 对象要慢得多。</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Set class is iterable, which means that you can use a for/of loop to enumerate all of the elements of a set:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Set 类是可迭代的，这意味着您可以使用 for/of 循环枚举集合中的所有元素：</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">let sum = 0;
for(let p of oneDigitPrimes) { // Loop through the one-digit primes
    sum += p;                  // and add them up
}
sum                            // =&gt; 17: 2 + 3 + 5 + 7
</code></pre>

<p>Because Set objects are iterable, you can convert them to arrays and argument lists with the ... spread operator:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>因为 Set 对象是可迭代的，所以可以使用 ... 展开运算符将它们转换为数组和实参列表：</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">[...oneDigitPrimes]         // =&gt; [2,3,5,7]: the set converted to an Array
Math.max(...oneDigitPrimes) // =&gt; 7: set elements passed as function arguments
</code></pre>

<p>Sets are often described as “unordered collections.” This isn’t exactly true for the JavaScript Set class, however. A JavaScript set is unindexed: you can’t ask for the first or third element of a set the way you can with an array. But the JavaScript Set class always remembers the order that elements were inserted in, and it always uses this order when you iterate a set: the first element inserted will be the first one iterated (assuming you haven’t deleted it first), and the most recently inserted element will be the last one iterated. [<sup>2]</sup></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Set 通常被称为“无序集合”。 但是，对于 JavaScript 的 Set 类而言，并非完全如此。JavaScript Set 未索引：无法像使用数组那样获取 Set 的第一个或第三个元素。 但是 JavaScript Set 类始终记住插入元素的顺序，并且在遍历集合时始终使用此顺序：插入的第一个元素将是第一个遍历的元素（假定没有先删除它），并且，最后插入的元素将是最后一个遍历的元素。</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In addition to being iterable, the Set class also implements a forEach() method that is similar to the array method of the same name:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>除了可迭代之外，Set 类还实现了一个 forEach() 方法，该方法类似于同名的 array 方法：</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">let product = 1;
oneDigitPrimes.forEach(n =&gt; { product *= n; });
product     // =&gt; 210: 2 * 3 * 5 * 7
</code></pre>

<p>The forEach() of an array passes array indexes as the second argument to the function you specify. Sets don’t have indexes, so the Set class’s version of this method simply passes the element value as both the first and second argument.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>数组的 forEach() 将数组索引作为指定函数的第二个实参传递。集合没有索引，因此此方法的 Set 类版本仅将元素值作为第一个和第二个实参传递。</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="toc_3">11.1.2 The Map Class</h3>

<p>A Map object represents a set of values known as keys, where each key has another value associated with (or “mapped to”) it. In a sense, a map is like an array, but instead of using a set of sequential integers as the keys, maps allow us to use arbitrary values as “indexes.” Like arrays, maps are fast: looking up the value associated with a key will be fast (though not as fast as indexing an array) no matter how large the map is.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Map 对象代表一组称为键的值，其中每个键具有与其关联（或“映射到”）的另一个值。从某种意义上讲，映射就像一个数组，但是映射不是使用一组连续的整数作为键，而是允许我们使用任意值作为“索引”。像数组一样，映射是快速的：无论映射有多大查找与键关联的值都很快（尽管不如索引数组快）。</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Create a new map with the Map() constructor:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>用 Map() 构造函数闯将一个 map：</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">let m = new Map();  // Create a new, empty map
let n = new Map([   // A new map initialized with string keys mapped to numbers
    [&quot;one&quot;, 1],
    [&quot;two&quot;, 2]
]);
</code></pre>

<p>The optional argument to the Map() constructor should be an iterable object that yields two element [key, value] arrays. In practice, this means that if you want to initialize a map when you create it, you’ll typically write out the desired keys and associated values as an array of arrays. But you can also use the Map() constructor to copy other maps or to copy the property names and values from an existing object:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Map() 构造函数的可选实参应该是一个可迭代的对象，该对象可产生两个元素 [key，value] 数组。 实际上，这意味着如果要在创建 map 时初始化，通常会将所需的键和映射的值写为数组的数组。 但是，也可以使用 Map() 构造函数复制其他 map，或者从现有对象复制属性名称和值：</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">let copy = new Map(n); // A new map with the same keys and values as map n
let o = { x: 1, y: 2}; // An object with two properties
let p = new Map(Object.entries(o)); // Same as new map([[&quot;x&quot;, 1], [&quot;y&quot;, 2]])
</code></pre>

<p>Once you have created a Map object, you can query the value associated with a given key with get() and can add a new key/value pair with set(). Remember, though, that a map is a set of keys, each of which has an associated value. This is not quite the same as a set of key/value pairs. If you call set() with a key that already exists in the map, you will change the value associated with that key, not add a new key/value mapping. In addition to get() and set(), the Map class also defines methods that are like Set methods: use has() to check whether a map includes the specified key; use delete() to remove a key (and its associated value) from the map; use clear() to remove all key/value pairs from the map; and use the size property to find out how many keys a map contains.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>创建 Map 对象后，可以用 get() 查询给定键的值，并可以用 set() 添加新的键值对。但是请记住，map 是一组键，每个键映射一个值。这与一组键值对不太相同。如果调用 set() 添加一个 map 中已存在的键的键值对，会改变这个键映射的值，而不是添加一个新的键值对映射。除了 get() 和 set()，Map 类也定义了类似于 Set 的方法：使用 has() 判断 map 是否包含指定键；使用 delete() 删除 map 中的一个键（和它映射的值）；使用 clear() 来移除 map 中所有的键值对；使用 size 属性知道 map 中包含多少个键。</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">let m = new Map();   // Start with an empty map
m.size               // =&gt; 0: empty maps have no keys
m.set(&quot;one&quot;, 1);     // Map the key &quot;one&quot; to the value 1
m.set(&quot;two&quot;, 2);     // And the key &quot;two&quot; to the value 2.
m.size               // =&gt; 2: the map now has two keys
m.get(&quot;two&quot;)         // =&gt; 2: return the value associated with key &quot;two&quot;
m.get(&quot;three&quot;)       // =&gt; undefined: this key is not in the set
m.set(&quot;one&quot;, true);  // Change the value associated with an existing key
m.size               // =&gt; 2: the size doesn&#39;t change
m.has(&quot;one&quot;)         // =&gt; true: the map has a key &quot;one&quot;
m.has(true)          // =&gt; false: the map does not have a key true
m.delete(&quot;one&quot;)      // =&gt; true: the key existed and deletion succeeded
m.size               // =&gt; 1
m.delete(&quot;three&quot;)    // =&gt; false: failed to delete a nonexistent key
m.clear();           // Remove all keys and values from the map
</code></pre>

<p>Like the add() method of Set, the set() method of Map can be chained, which allows maps to be initialized without using arrays of arrays:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>像 Set 的 add() 方法一样，Map 的 set() 方法也可以链式使用，这允许在不使用数组的情况下初始化 map：</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">let m = new Map().set(&quot;one&quot;, 1).set(&quot;two&quot;, 2).set(&quot;three&quot;, 3);
m.size        // =&gt; 3
m.get(&quot;two&quot;)  // =&gt; 2
</code></pre>

<p>As with Set, any JavaScript value can be used as a key or a value in a Map. This includes null, undefined, and NaN, as well as reference types like objects and arrays. And as with the Set class, Map compares keys by identity, not by equality, so if you use an object or array as a key, it will be considered different from every other object and array, even those with exactly the same properties or elements:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>与 Set 一样，任何 JavaScript 的值都可以被用作 Map 的键或值。包括 null、undefined 和 NaN，也包括像对象和数组这种引用类型。并且和 Set 类一样，Map 通过标识来比较，不是通过相等，所以如果想要使用对象或数组作为键，它们会被认为不同于任何其他的对象和数组，即使那些属性或元素完全相同的引用：</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">let m = new Map();   // Start with an empty map.
m.set({}, 1);        // Map one empty object to the number 1.
m.set({}, 2);        // Map a different empty object to the number 2.
m.size               // =&gt; 2: there are two keys in this map
m.get({})            // =&gt; undefined: but this empty object is not a key
m.set(m, undefined); // Map the map itself to the value undefined.
m.has(m)             // =&gt; true: m is a key in itself
m.get(m)             // =&gt; undefined: same value we&#39;d get if m wasn&#39;t a key
</code></pre>

<p>Map objects are iterable, and each iterated value is a two-element array where the first element is a key and the second element is the value associated with that key. If you use the spread operator with a Map object, you’ll get an array of arrays like the ones that we passed to the Map() constructor. And when iterating a map with a for/of loop, it is idiomatic to use destructuring assignment to assign the key and value to separate variables:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Map 是可迭代对象，每一个迭代值是两个元素数组，第一个元素是键，第二个元素是键映射的值。如果对 Map 对象使用展开运算符，会得到一个数组的数组，就像传递给 Map() 构造函数的实参。当使用 for/of 循环遍历一个 map 时，常使用解构赋值将键和值赋值给展开变量：</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">let m = new Map([[&quot;x&quot;, 1], [&quot;y&quot;, 2]]);
[...m]    // =&gt; [[&quot;x&quot;, 1], [&quot;y&quot;, 2]]

for(let [key, value] of m) {
    // On the first iteration, key will be &quot;x&quot; and value will be 1
    // On the second iteration, key will be &quot;y&quot; and value will be 2
}
</code></pre>

<p>Like the Set class, the Map class iterates in insertion order. The first key/value pair iterated will be the one least recently added to the map, and the last pair iterated will be the one most recently added.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>与 Set 类一样，Map 类按照插入顺序进行遍历。遍历的第一个键值对将是最早添加到 map 中的，而遍历的最后一个键值对将是最新添加的。</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you want to iterate just the keys or just the associated values of a map, use the keys() and values() methods: these return iterable objects that iterate keys and values, in insertion order. (The entries() method returns an iterable object that iterates key/value pairs, but this is exactly the same as iterating the map directly.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>如果只想遍历 map 中的键或者映射的值，使用 keys() 和 values() 方法：它们返回按照插入顺序排列的键或值可迭代对象。（entries() 方法返回一个迭代对象，该对象迭代键值对，但这与直接迭代 map 完全相同。）</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">[...m.keys()]     // =&gt; [&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;]: just the keys
[...m.values()]   // =&gt; [1, 2]: just the values
[...m.entries()]  // =&gt; [[&quot;x&quot;, 1], [&quot;y&quot;, 2]]: same as [...m]
</code></pre>

<p>Map objects can also be iterated using the forEach() method that was first implemented by the Array class.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Map 对象也可以使用 forEach() 方法进行遍历。</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">m.forEach((value, key) =&gt; {  // note value, key NOT key, value
    // On the first invocation, value will be 1 and key will be &quot;x&quot;
    // On the second invocation, value will be 2 and key will be &quot;y&quot;
});
</code></pre>

<p>It may seem strange that the value parameter comes before the key parameter in the code above, since with for/of iteration, the key comes first. As noted at the start of this section, you can think of a map as a generalized array in which integer array indexes are replaced with arbitrary key values. The forEach() method of arrays passes the array element first and the array index second, so, by analogy, the forEach() method of a map passes the map value first and the map key second.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>上面的代码中 value 参数位于 key 参数之前，这似乎很奇怪，因为对于 for/of 迭代，key 放在前面。如本节开头所述，可以将映射视为通用数组，其中整数数组索引被替换为任意键值。数组的 forEach() 方法首先传递数组元素，然后传递数组索引，因此，以此类推，map 的 forEach() 方法首先传递 map 的值，然后传递 map 键。</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="toc_4">11.1.3 WeakMap and WeakSet</h3>

<p>The WeakMap class is a variant (but not an actual subclass) of the Map class that does not prevent its key values from being garbage collected. Garbage collection is the process by which the JavaScript interpreter reclaims the memory of objects that are no longer “reachable” and cannot be used by the program. A regular map holds “strong” references to its key values, and they remain reachable through the map, even if all other references to them are gone. The WeakMap, by contrast, keeps “weak” references to its key values so that they are not reachable through the WeakMap, and their presence in the map does not prevent their memory from being reclaimed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>WeakMap 类是 Map 类的变体（但不是真正的子类），它不会阻止其键值被垃圾回收。垃圾回收是 JavaScript 解释器回收不再“可访问”并且无法由程序使用的对象的内存的过程。常规 map 保留对其键值的“强”引用，即使对它们的所有其他引用都已消失，它们仍然可以通过映射访问。相比之下，WeakMap 保留对其键值的“弱”引用，以使它们无法通过 WeakMap 获得，并且它们在 map 中的存在也不会阻止对其内存的回收。</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The WeakMap() constructor is just like the Map() constructor, but there are some significant differences between WeakMap and Map:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>WeakMap() 构造函数类似 Map() 构造函数，但是有一些重要的不同：</p>
</blockquote>

<p>WeakMap keys must be objects or arrays; primitive values are not subject to garbage collection and cannot be used as keys.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>WeakMap 键必须是对象或数组；原始值不受垃圾回收的限制，不能用作键。</p>
</blockquote>

<p>WeakMap implements only the get(), set(), has(), and delete() methods. In particular, WeakMap is not iterable and does not define keys(), values(), or forEach(). If WeakMap was iterable, then its keys would be reachable and it wouldn’t be weak.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>WeakMap 仅实现 get()、set()、has() 和 delete() 方法。 特别是，WeakMap 是不可迭代的，并且未定义 keys()、values() 或 forEach()。如果 WeakMap 是可迭代的，则其键将是可访问的，这让它不会“弱”。</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Similarly, WeakMap does not implement the size property because the size of a WeakMap could change at any time as objects are garbage collected.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>同样，WeakMap 也不实现 size 属性，因为随着对象被垃圾回收，WeakMap 的大小可能随时更改。</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The intended use of WeakMap is to allow you to associate values with objects without causing memory leaks. Suppose, for example, that you are writing a function that takes an object argument and needs to perform some time-consuming computation on that object. For efficiency, you’d like to cache the computed value for later reuse. If you use a Map object to implement the cache, you will prevent any of the objects from ever being reclaimed, but by using a WeakMap, you avoid this problem. (You can often achieve a similar result using a private Symbol property to cache the computed value directly on the object. See §6.10.3.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>WeakMap 的预期用途是允许将值与对象相关联而不会引起内存泄漏。例如，假设正在编写一个带有对象实参的函数，并且需要对该对象执行一些耗时的计算。为了提高效率，希望将计算出的值进行缓存以备后用。如果使用 Map 对象实现缓存，则将防止回收任何对象，但是通过使用 WeakMap，可以避免此问题。（通常可以使用私有的 Symbol 属性将计算的值直接缓存在对象上，从而获得相似的结果。请参见 §6.10.3。）</p>
</blockquote>

<p>WeakSet implements a set of objects that does not prevent those objects from being garbage collected. The WeakSet() constructor works like the Set() constructor, but WeakSet objects differ from Set objects in the same ways that WeakMap objects differ from Map objects:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>WeakSet 实现了一组对象，这些对象不会阻止垃圾回收这些对象。 WeakSet() 构造函数的工作方式类似于 Set() 构造函数，但 WeakSet 对象与 Set 对象的区别与 WeakMap 对象与 Map 对象的区别相同：</p>
</blockquote>

<p>WeakSet does not allow primitive values as members.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>WeakSet 不允许原始值作为成员。</p>
</blockquote>

<p>WeakSet implements only the add(), has(), and delete() methods and is not iterable.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>WeakSet 仅实现 add()、has() 和 delete() 方法，并且不可迭代。</p>
</blockquote>

<p>WeakSet does not have a size property.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>WeakSet 没有 size 属性。</p>
</blockquote>

<p>WeakSet is not frequently used: its use cases are like those for WeakMap. If you want to mark (or “brand”) an object as having some special property or type, for example, you could add it to a WeakSet. Then, elsewhere, when you want to check for that property or type, you can test for membership in that WeakSet. Doing this with a regular set would prevent all marked objects from being garbage collected, but this is not a concern when using WeakSet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>WeakSet 并不经常使用：其用例类似于 WeakMap 的用例。例如，如果要标记（或“烙印”）对象具有某些特殊属性或类型，则可以将其添加到 WeakSet 中。然后，在其他位置，当要检查该属性或类型时，可以测试该 WeakSet 中的成员身份。使用常规 Set 执行此操作将防止所有标记的对象被垃圾回收，但这在使用 WeakSet 时不必担心。</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="toc_5">11.2 Typed Arrays and Binary Data</h2>

<p>Regular JavaScript arrays can have elements of any type and can grow or shrink dynamically. JavaScript implementations perform lots of optimizations so that typical uses of JavaScript arrays are very fast. Nevertheless, they are still quite different from the array types of lower-level languages like C and Java. Typed arrays, which are new in ES6 [<sup>3]</sup> are much closer to the low-level arrays of those languages. Typed arrays are not technically arrays (Array.isArray() returns false for them), but they implement all of the array methods described in §7.8 plus a few more of their own. They differ from regular arrays in some very important ways, however:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>常规 JavaScript 数组可以具有任何类型的元素，并且可以动态增长或收缩。JavaScript 实现执行了大量优化，因此 JavaScript 数组的典型用法非常快。但是，它们仍然与诸如 C 和 Java 的低级语言的数组类型有很大不同。 ES6 [<sup>3]</sup> 中新增的类型化数组更接近那些语言的低级数组。从类型上讲，类型化数组不是数组（Array.isArray() 为其返回false），但是它们实现了 §7.8 中描述的所有数组方法以及它们自己的其他一些方法。但是，它们在某些非常重要的方面与常规数组有所不同： </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The elements of a typed array are all numbers. Unlike regular JavaScript numbers, however, typed arrays allow you to specify the type (signed and unsigned integers and IEEE-754 floating point) and size (8 bits to 64 bits) of the numbers to be stored in the array.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>类型化数组的元素都是数字。 但是，与常规 JavaScript 数字不同，类型化数组允许指定要存储在数组中的数字的类型（有符号和无符号整数以及 IEEE-754 浮点数）和大小（8 位至 64 位）。 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You must specify the length of a typed array when you create it, and that length can never change.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>创建类型化数组时，必须指定其长度，并且该长度永远不会改变。 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The elements of a typed array are always initialized to 0 when the array is created.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>创建数组时，类型化数组的元素始终会初始化为 0。</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="toc_6">11.2.1 Typed Array Types</h3>

<p>JavaScript does not define a TypedArray class. Instead, there are 11 kinds of typed arrays, each with a different element type and constructor:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>JavaScript 没有定义 TypedArray 类。相反，有11种类型化数组，每种类型具有不同的元素类型和构造函数： </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Constructor Numeric type</p>

<p>Int8Array()</p>

<p>signed bytes</p>

<p>Uint8Array()</p>

<p>unsigned bytes</p>

<p>Uint8ClampedArray()</p>

<p>unsigned bytes without rollover</p>

<p>Int16Array()</p>

<p>signed 16-bit short integers</p>

<p>Uint16Array()</p>

<p>unsigned 16-bit short integers</p>

<p>Int32Array()</p>

<p>signed 32-bit integers</p>

<p>Uint32Array()</p>

<p>unsigned 32-bit integers</p>

<p>BigInt64Array()</p>

<p>signed 64-bit BigInt values (ES2020)</p>

<p>BigUint64Array()</p>

<p>unsigned 64-bit BigInt values (ES2020)</p>

<p>Float32Array()</p>

<p>32-bit floating-point value</p>

<p>Float64Array()</p>

<p>64-bit floating-point value: a regular JavaScript number</p>

<p>The types whose names begin with Int hold signed integers, of 1, 2, or 4 bytes (8, 16, or 32 bits). The types whose names begin with Uint hold unsigned integers of those same lengths. The “BigInt” and “BigUint” types hold 64-bit integers, represented in JavaScript as BigInt values (see §3.2.5). The types that begin with Float hold floating-point numbers. The elements of a Float64Array are of the same type as regular JavaScript numbers. The elements of a Float32Array have lower precision and a smaller range but require only half the memory. (This type is called float in C and Java.)</p>

<p>Uint8ClampedArray is a special-case variant on Uint8Array. Both of these types hold unsigned bytes and can represent numbers between 0 and 255. With Uint8Array, if you store a value larger than 255 or less than zero into an array element, it “wraps around,” and you get some other value. This is how computer memory works at a low level, so this is very fast. Uint8ClampedArray does some extra type checking so that, if you store a value greater than 255 or less than 0, it “clamps” to 255 or 0 and does not wrap around. (This clamping behavior is required by the HTML <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element’s low-level API for manipulating pixel colors.)</p>

<p>Each of the typed array constructors has a BYTES_PER_ELEMENT property with the value 1, 2, 4, or 8, depending on the type.</p>

<h3 id="toc_7">11.2.2 Creating Typed Arrays</h3>

<p>The simplest way to create a typed array is to call the appropriate constructor with one numeric argument that specifies the number of elements you want in the array:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">let bytes = new Uint8Array(1024);    // 1024 bytes
let matrix = new Float64Array(9);    // A 3x3 matrix
let point = new Int16Array(3);       // A point in 3D space
let rgba = new Uint8ClampedArray(4); // A 4-byte RGBA pixel value
let sudoku = new Int8Array(81);      // A 9x9 sudoku board
</code></pre>

<p>When you create typed arrays in this way, the array elements are all guaranteed to be initialized to 0, 0n, or 0.0. But if you know the values you want in your typed array, you can also specify those values when you create the array. Each of the typed array constructors has static from() and of() factory methods that work like Array.from() and Array.of():</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">let white = Uint8ClampedArray.of(255, 255, 255, 0);  // RGBA opaque white
</code></pre>

<p>Recall that the Array.from() factory method expects an array-like or iterable object as its first argument. The same is true for the typed array variants, except that the iterable or array-like object must also have numeric elements. Strings are iterable, for example, but it would make no sense to pass them to the from() factory method of a typed array.</p>

<p>If you are just using the one-argument version of from(), you can drop the .from and pass your iterable or array-like object directly to the constructor function, which behaves exactly the same. Note that both the constructor and the from() factory method allow you to copy existing typed arrays, while possibly changing the type:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">let ints = Uint32Array.from(white);  // The same 4 numbers, but as ints
</code></pre>

<p>When you create a new typed array from an existing array, iterable, or array-like object, the values may be truncated in order to fit the type constraints of your array. There are no warnings or errors when this happens:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">// Floats truncated to ints, longer ints truncated to 8 bits
Uint8Array.of(1.23, 2.99, 45000) // =&gt; new Uint8Array([1, 2, 200])
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, there is one more way to create typed arrays that involves the ArrayBuffer type. An ArrayBuffer is an opaque reference to a chunk of memory. You can create one with the constructor; just pass in the number of bytes of memory you’d like to allocate:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">let buffer = new ArrayBuffer(1024*1024);
buffer.byteLength   // =&gt; 1024*1024; one megabyte of memory
</code></pre>

<p>The ArrayBuffer class does not allow you to read or write any of the bytes that you have allocated. But you can create typed arrays that use the buffer’s memory and that do allow you to read and write that memory. To do this, call the typed array constructor with an ArrayBuffer as the first argument, a byte offset within the array buffer as the second argument, and the array length (in elements, not in bytes) as the third argument. The second and third arguments are optional. If you omit both, then the array will use all of the memory in the array buffer. If you omit only the length argument, then your array will use all of the available memory between the start position and the end of the array. One more thing to bear in mind about this form of the typed array constructor: arrays must be memory aligned, so if you specify a byte offset, the value should be a multiple of the size of your type. The Int32Array() constructor requires a multiple of four, for example, and the Float64Array() requires a multiple of eight.</p>

<p>Given the ArrayBuffer created earlier, you could create typed arrays like these:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">let asbytes = new Uint8Array(buffer);          // Viewed as bytes
let asints = new Int32Array(buffer);           // Viewed as 32-bit signed ints
let lastK = new Uint8Array(buffer, 1023*1024); // Last kilobyte as bytes
let ints2 = new Int32Array(buffer, 1024, 256); // 2nd kilobyte as 256 integers
</code></pre>

<p>These four typed arrays offer four different views into the memory represented by the ArrayBuffer. It is important to understand that all typed arrays have an underlying ArrayBuffer, even if you do not explicitly specify one. If you call a typed array constructor without passing a buffer object, a buffer of the appropriate size will be automatically created. As described later, the buffer property of any typed array refers to its underlying ArrayBuffer object. The reason to work directly with ArrayBuffer objects is that sometimes you may want to have multiple typed array views of a single buffer.</p>

<h3 id="toc_8">11.2.3 Using Typed Arrays</h3>

<p>Once you have created a typed array, you can read and write its elements with regular square-bracket notation, just as you would with any other array-like object:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">// Return the largest prime smaller than n, using the sieve of Eratosthenes
function sieve(n) {
    let a = new Uint8Array(n+1);         // a[x] will be 1 if x is composite
    let max = Math.floor(Math.sqrt(n));  // Don&#39;t do factors higher than this
    let p = 2;                           // 2 is the first prime
    while(p &lt;= max) {                    // For primes less than max
        for(let i = 2*p; i &lt;= n; i += p) // Mark multiples of p as composite
            a[i] = 1;
        while(a[++p]) /* empty */;       // The next unmarked index is prime
    }
    while(a[n]) n--;                     // Loop backward to find the last prime
    return n;                            // And return it
}
</code></pre>

<p>The function here computes the largest prime number smaller than the number you specify. The code is exactly the same as it would be with a regular JavaScript array, but using Uint8Array() instead of Array() makes the code run more than four times faster and use eight times less memory in my testing.</p>

<p>Typed arrays are not true arrays, but they re-implement most array methods, so you can use them pretty much just like you’d use regular arrays:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">let ints = new Int16Array(10);       // 10 short integers
ints.fill(3).map(x=&gt;x*x).join(&quot;&quot;)    // =&gt; &quot;9999999999&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>Remember that typed arrays have fixed lengths, so the length property is read-only, and methods that change the length of the array (such as push(), pop(), unshift(), shift(), and splice()) are not implemented for typed arrays. Methods that alter the contents of an array without changing the length (such as sort(), reverse(), and fill()) are implemented. Methods like map() and slice() that return new arrays return a typed array of the same type as the one they are called on.</p>

<h3 id="toc_9">11.2.4 Typed Array Methods and Properties</h3>

<p>In addition to standard array methods, typed arrays also implement a few methods of their own. The set() method sets multiple elements of a typed array at once by copying the elements of a regular or typed array into a typed array:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">let bytes = new Uint8Array(1024);        // A 1K buffer
let pattern = new Uint8Array([0,1,2,3]); // An array of 4 bytes
bytes.set(pattern);      // Copy them to the start of another byte array
bytes.set(pattern, 4);   // Copy them again at a different offset
bytes.set([0,1,2,3], 8); // Or just copy values direct from a regular array
bytes.slice(0, 12)       // =&gt; new Uint8Array([0,1,2,3,0,1,2,3,0,1,2,3])
</code></pre>

<p>The set() method takes an array or typed array as its first argument and an element offset as its optional second argument, which defaults to 0 if left unspecified. If you are copying values from one typed array to another, the operation will likely be extremely fast.</p>

<p>Typed arrays also have a subarray method that returns a portion of the array on which it is called:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">let ints = new Int16Array([0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]);       // 10 short integers
let last3 = ints.subarray(ints.length-3, ints.length);  // Last 3 of them
last3[0]       // =&gt; 7: this is the same as ints[7]
</code></pre>

<p>subarray() takes the same arguments as the slice() method and seems to work the same way. But there is an important difference. slice() returns the specified elements in a new, independent typed array that does not share memory with the original array. subarray() does not copy any memory; it just returns a new view of the same underlying values:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">ints[9] = -1;  // Change a value in the original array and...
last3[2]       // =&gt; -1: it also changes in the subarray
</code></pre>

<p>The fact that the subarray() method returns a new view of an existing array brings us back to the topic of ArrayBuffers. Every typed array has three properties that relate to the underlying buffer:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">last3.buffer                 // The ArrayBuffer object for a typed array
last3.buffer === ints.buffer // =&gt; true: both are views of the same buffer
last3.byteOffset             // =&gt; 14: this view starts at byte 14 of the buffer
last3.byteLength             // =&gt; 6: this view is 6 bytes (3 16-bit ints) long
last3.buffer.byteLength      // =&gt; 20: but the underlying buffer has 20 bytes
</code></pre>

<p>The buffer property is the ArrayBuffer of the array. byteOffset is the starting position of the array’s data within the underlying buffer. And byteLength is the length of the array’s data in bytes. For any typed array, a, this invariant should always be true:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">a.length * a.BYTES_PER_ELEMENT === a.byteLength  // =&gt; true
</code></pre>

<p>ArrayBuffers are just opaque chunks of bytes. You can access those bytes with typed arrays, but an ArrayBuffer is not itself a typed array. Be careful, however: you can use numeric array indexing with ArrayBuffers just as you can with any JavaScript object. Doing so does not give you access to the bytes in the buffer, but it can cause confusing bugs:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">let bytes = new Uint8Array(8);
bytes[0] = 1;           // Set the first byte to 1
bytes.buffer[0]         // =&gt; undefined: buffer doesn&#39;t have index 0
bytes.buffer[1] = 255;  // Try incorrectly to set a byte in the buffer
bytes.buffer[1]         // =&gt; 255: this just sets a regular JS property
bytes[1]                // =&gt; 0: the line above did not set the byte
</code></pre>

<p>We saw previously that you can create an ArrayBuffer with the ArrayBuffer() constructor and then create typed arrays that use that buffer. Another approach is to create an initial typed array, then use the buffer of that array to create other views:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">let bytes = new Uint8Array(1024);            // 1024 bytes
let ints = new Uint32Array(bytes.buffer);    // or 256 integers
let floats = new Float64Array(bytes.buffer); // or 128 doubles
</code></pre>

<h3 id="toc_10">11.2.5 DataView and Endianness</h3>

<p>Typed arrays allow you to view the same sequence of bytes in chunks of 8, 16, 32, or 64 bits. This exposes the “endianness”: the order in which bytes are arranged into longer words. For efficiency, typed arrays use the native endianness of the underlying hardware. On little-endian systems, the bytes of a number are arranged in an ArrayBuffer from least significant to most significant. On big-endian platforms, the bytes are arranged from most significant to least significant. You can determine the endianness of the underlying platform with code like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">// If the integer 0x00000001 is arranged in memory as 01 00 00 00, then
// we&#39;re on a little-endian platform. On a big-endian platform, we&#39;d get
// bytes 00 00 00 01 instead.
let littleEndian = new Int8Array(new Int32Array([1]).buffer)[0] === 1;
</code></pre>

<p>Today, the most common CPU architectures are little-endian. Many network protocols, and some binary file formats, require big-endian byte ordering, however. If you’re using typed arrays with data that came from the network or from a file, you can’t just assume that the platform endianness matches the byte order of the data. In general, when working with external data, you can use Int8Array and Uint8Array to view the data as an array of individual bytes, but you should not use the other typed arrays with multibyte word sizes. Instead, you can use the DataView class, which defines methods for reading and writing values from an ArrayBuffer with explicitly specified byte ordering:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">// Assume we have a typed array of bytes of binary data to process. First,
// we create a DataView object so we can flexibly read and write
// values from those bytes
let view = new DataView(bytes.buffer,
                        bytes.byteOffset,
                        bytes.byteLength);

let int = view.getInt32(0);     // Read big-endian signed int from byte 0
int = view.getInt32(4, false);  // Next int is also big-endian
int = view.getUint32(8, true);  // Next int is little-endian and unsigned
view.setUint32(8, int, false);  // Write it back in big-endian format
</code></pre>

<p>DataView defines 10 get methods for each of the 10 typed array classes (excluding Uint8ClampedArray). They have names like getInt16(), getUint32(), getBigInt64(), and getFloat64(). The first argument is the byte offset within the ArrayBuffer at which the value begins. All of these getter methods, other than getInt8() and getUint8(), accept an optional boolean value as their second argument. If the second argument is omitted or is false, big-endian byte ordering is used. If the second argument is true, little-endian ordering is used.</p>

<p>DataView also defines 10 corresponding Set methods that write values into the underlying ArrayBuffer. The first argument is the offset at which the value begins. The second argument is the value to write. Each of the methods, except setInt8() and setUint8(), accepts an optional third argument. If the argument is omitted or is false, the value is written in big-endian format with the most significant byte first. If the argument is true, the value is written in little-endian format with the least significant byte first.</p>

<p>Typed arrays and the DataView class give you all the tools you need to process binary data and enable you to write JavaScript programs that do things like decompressing ZIP files or extracting metadata from JPEG files.</p>

<h2 id="toc_11">11.3 Pattern Matching with Regular Expressions</h2>

<p>A regular expression is an object that describes a textual pattern. The JavaScript RegExp class represents regular expressions, and both String and RegExp define methods that use regular expressions to perform powerful pattern-matching and search-and-replace functions on text. In order to use the RegExp API effectively, however, you must also learn how to describe patterns of text using the regular expression grammar, which is essentially a mini programming language of its own. Fortunately, the JavaScript regular expression grammar is quite similar to the grammar used by many other programming languages, so you may already be familiar with it. (And if you are not, the effort you invest in learning JavaScript regular expressions will probably be useful to you in other programming contexts as well.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>正则表达式是描述文本模式的对象。JavaScript RegExp 类表示正则表达式，而 String 和 RegExp 都定义了使用正则表达式对文本执行强大的模式匹配和搜索替换功能的方法。但是，为了有效地使用 RegExp API，还必须学习如何使用正则表达式语法描述文本模式，该语法本质上是其自身的一种小型编程语言。幸运的是，JavaScript 正则表达式语法与许多其他编程语言所使用的语法非常相似，因此您可能已经很熟悉它。（如果不是这样，则在学习 JavaScript 正则表达式上投入的精力也可能在其他编程环境中对您很有用。） </p>

<h3 id="toc_12">11.3.1 Defining Regular Expressions</h3>

<p>In JavaScript, regular expressions are represented by RegExp objects. RegExp objects may be created with the RegExp() constructor, of course, but they are more often created using a special literal syntax. Just as string literals are specified as characters within quotation marks, regular expression literals are specified as characters within a pair of slash (/) characters. Thus, your JavaScript code may contain lines like this:</p>

<p>let pattern = /s$/;<br/>
This line creates a new RegExp object and assigns it to the variable pattern. This particular RegExp object matches any string that ends with the letter “s.” This regular expression could have equivalently been defined with the RegExp() constructor, like this:</p>

<p>let pattern = new RegExp(&quot;s\(&quot;);<br/>
Regular-expression pattern specifications consist of a series of characters. Most characters, including all alphanumeric characters, simply describe characters to be matched literally. Thus, the regular expression /java/ matches any string that contains the substring “java”. Other characters in regular expressions are not matched literally but have special significance. For example, the regular expression /s\)/ contains two characters. The first, “s”, matches itself literally. The second, “$”, is a special meta-character that matches the end of a string. Thus, this regular expression matches any string that contains the letter “s” as its last character.</p>

<p>As we’ll see, regular expressions can also have one or more flag characters that affect how they work. Flags are specified following the second slash character in RegExp literals, or as a second string argument to the RegExp() constructor. If we wanted to match strings that end with “s” or “S”, for example, we could use the i flag with our regular expression to indicate that we want case-insensitive matching:</p>

<p>let pattern = /s$/i;<br/>
The following sections describe the various characters and meta-characters used in JavaScript regular expressions.</p>

<p>LITERAL CHARACTERS<br/>
All alphabetic characters and digits match themselves literally in regular expressions. JavaScript regular expression syntax also supports certain nonalphabetic characters through escape sequences that begin with a backslash <code>(\)</code>. For example, the sequence \n matches a literal newline character in a string. Table 11-1 lists these characters.</p>

<p>Table 11-1. Regular-expression literal characters<br/>
Character   Matches<br/>
Alphanumeric character</p>

<p>Itself</p>

<p>\0</p>

<p>The NUL character (\u0000)</p>

<p>\t</p>

<p>Tab (\u0009)</p>

<p>\n</p>

<p>Newline (\u000A)</p>

<p>\v</p>

<p>Vertical tab (\u000B)</p>

<p>\f</p>

<p>Form feed (\u000C)</p>

<p>\r</p>

<p>Carriage return (\u000D)</p>

<p>\xnn</p>

<p>The Latin character specified by the hexadecimal number nn; for example, \x0A is the same as \n.</p>

<p>\uxxxx</p>

<p>The Unicode character specified by the hexadecimal number xxxx; for example, \u0009 is the same as \t.</p>

<p>\u{n}</p>

<p>The Unicode character specified by the codepoint n, where n is one to six hexadecimal digits between 0 and 10FFFF. Note that this syntax is only supported in regular expressions that use the u flag.</p>

<p>\cX</p>

<p>The control character <sup>X;</sup> for example, \cJ is equivalent to the newline character \n.</p>

<p>A number of punctuation characters have special meanings in regular expressions. They are:</p>

<pre><code class="language-text">^ $ . * + ? = ! : | \ / ( ) [ ] { }
</code></pre>

<p>The meanings of these characters are discussed in the sections that follow. Some of these characters have special meaning only within certain contexts of a regular expression and are treated literally in other contexts. As a general rule, however, if you want to include any of these punctuation characters literally in a regular expression, you must precede them with a <code>\</code>. Other punctuation characters, such as quotation marks and @, do not have special meaning and simply match themselves literally in a regular expression.</p>

<p>If you can’t remember exactly which punctuation characters need to be escaped with a backslash, you may safely place a backslash before any punctuation character. On the other hand, note that many letters and numbers have special meaning when preceded by a backslash, so any letters or numbers that you want to match literally should not be escaped with a backslash. To include a backslash character literally in a regular expression, you must escape it with a backslash, of course. For example, the following regular expression matches any string that includes a backslash: <code>/\\/</code>. (And if you use the RegExp() constructor, keep in mind that any backslashes in your regular expression need to be doubled, since strings also use backslashes as an escape character.)</p>

<p>CHARACTER CLASSES<br/>
Individual literal characters can be combined into character classes by placing them within square brackets. A character class matches any one character that is contained within it. Thus, the regular expression <code>/[abc]/</code> matches any one of the letters a, b, or c. Negated character classes can also be defined; these match any character except those contained within the brackets. A negated character class is specified by placing a caret (<sup>)</sup> as the first character inside the left bracket. The RegExp <code>/[^abc]/</code> matches any one character other than a, b, or c. Character classes can use a hyphen to indicate a range of characters. To match any one lowercase character from the Latin alphabet, use <code>/[a-z]/</code>, and to match any letter or digit from the Latin alphabet, use <code>/[a-zA-Z0-9]/.</code> (And if you want to include an actual hyphen in your character class, simply make it the last character before the right bracket.)</p>

<p>Because certain character classes are commonly used, the JavaScript regular-expression syntax includes special characters and escape sequences to represent these common classes. For example, \s matches the space character, the tab character, and any other Unicode whitespace character; \S matches any character that is not Unicode whitespace. Table 11-2 lists these characters and summarizes character-class syntax. (Note that several of these character-class escape sequences match only ASCII characters and have not been extended to work with Unicode characters. You can, however, explicitly define your own Unicode character classes; for example, <code>/[\u0400-\u04FF]/</code> matches any one Cyrillic character.)</p>

<p>Table 11-2. Regular expression character classes<br/>
Character   Matches<br/>
[...]</p>

<p>Any one character between the brackets.</p>

<p>[<sup>...]</sup></p>

<p>Any one character not between the brackets.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>Any character except newline or another Unicode line terminator. Or, if the RegExp uses the s flag, then a period matches any character, including line terminators.</p>

<p>\w</p>

<p>Any ASCII word character. Equivalent to [a-zA-Z0-9_].</p>

<p>\W</p>

<p>Any character that is not an ASCII word character. Equivalent to [<sup>a-zA-Z0-9_].</sup></p>

<p>\s</p>

<p>Any Unicode whitespace character.</p>

<p>\S</p>

<p>Any character that is not Unicode whitespace.</p>

<p>\d</p>

<p>Any ASCII digit. Equivalent to [0-9].</p>

<p>\D</p>

<p>Any character other than an ASCII digit. Equivalent to [<sup>0-9].</sup></p>

<p>[\b]</p>

<p>A literal backspace (special case).</p>

<p>Note that the special character-class escapes can be used within square brackets. \s matches any whitespace character, and \d matches any digit, so <code>/[\s\d]/</code> matches any one whitespace character or digit. Note that there is one special case. As you’ll see later, the \b escape has a special meaning. When used within a character class, however, it represents the backspace character. Thus, to represent a backspace character literally in a regular expression, use the character class with one element: <code>/[\b]/</code>.</p>

<p>UNICODE CHARACTER CLASSES<br/>
In ES2018, if a regular expression uses the u flag, then character classes \p{...} and its negation \P{...} are supported. (As of early 2020, this is implemented by Node, Chrome, Edge, and Safari, but not Firefox.) These character classes are based on properties defined by the Unicode standard, and the set of characters they represent may change as Unicode evolves.</p>

<p>The \d character class matches only ASCII digits. If you want to match one decimal digit from any of the world’s writing systems, you can use /\p{Decimal_Number}/u. And if you want to match any one character that is not a decimal digit in any language, you can capitalize the p and write \P{Decimal_Number}. If you want to match any number-like character, including fractions and roman numerals, you can use \p{Number}. Note that “Decimal_Number” and “Number” are not specific to JavaScript or to regular expression grammar: it is the name of a category of characters defined by the Unicode standard.</p>

<p>The \w character class only works for ASCII text, but with \p, we can approximate an internationalized version like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">/[\p{Alphabetic}\p{Decimal_Number}\p{Mark}]/u
</code></pre>

<p>(Though to be fully compatible with the complexity of the world’s languages, we really need to add in the categories “Connector_Punctuation” and “Join_Control” as well.)</p>

<p>As a final example, the \p syntax also allows us to define regular expressions that match characters from a particular alphabet or script:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">let greekLetter = /\p{Script=Greek}/u;
let cyrillicLetter = /\p{Script=Cyrillic}/u;
</code></pre>

<h4 id="toc_13">REPETITION</h4>

<p>With the regular expression syntax you’ve learned so far, you can describe a two-digit number as <code>/\d\d/</code> and a four-digit number as <code>/\d\d\d\d/</code>. But you don’t have any way to describe, for example, a number that can have any number of digits or a string of three letters followed by an optional digit. These more complex patterns use regular expression syntax that specifies how many times an element of a regular expression may be repeated.</p>

<p>The characters that specify repetition always follow the pattern to which they are being applied. Because certain types of repetition are quite commonly used, there are special characters to represent these cases. For example, + matches one or more occurrences of the previous pattern.</p>

<p>Table 11-3 summarizes the repetition syntax.</p>

<p>Table 11-3. Regular expression repetition characters<br/>
Character   Meaning<br/>
{n,m}</p>

<p>Match the previous item at least n times but no more than m times.</p>

<p>{n,}</p>

<p>Match the previous item n or more times.</p>

<p>{n}</p>

<p>Match exactly n occurrences of the previous item.</p>

<p>?</p>

<p>Match zero or one occurrences of the previous item. That is, the previous item is optional. Equivalent to {0,1}.</p>

<p>+</p>

<p>Match one or more occurrences of the previous item. Equivalent to {1,}.</p>

<p>*</p>

<p>Match zero or more occurrences of the previous item. Equivalent to {0,}.</p>

<p>The following lines show some examples:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">let r = /\d{2,4}/; // Match between two and four digits
r = /\w{3}\d?/;    // Match exactly three word characters and an optional digit
r = /\s+java\s+/;  // Match &quot;java&quot; with one or more spaces before and after
r = /[^(]*/;       // Match zero or more characters that are not open parens
</code></pre>

<p>Note that in all of these examples, the repetition specifiers apply to the single character or character class that precedes them. If you want to match repetitions of more complicated expressions, you’ll need to define a group with parentheses, which are explained in the following sections.</p>

<p>Be careful when using the * and ? repetition characters. Since these characters may match zero instances of whatever precedes them, they are allowed to match nothing. For example, the regular expression /a*/ actually matches the string “bbbb” because the string contains zero occurrences of the letter a!</p>

<h4 id="toc_14">NON-GREEDY REPETITION</h4>

<p>The repetition characters listed in Table 11-3 match as many times as possible while still allowing any following parts of the regular expression to match. We say that this repetition is “greedy.” It is also possible to specify that repetition should be done in a non-greedy way. Simply follow the repetition character or characters with a question mark: ??, +?, *?, or even {1,5}?. For example, the regular expression /a+/ matches one or more occurrences of the letter a. When applied to the string “aaa”, it matches all three letters. But /a+?/ matches one or more occurrences of the letter a, matching as few characters as necessary. When applied to the same string, this pattern matches only the first letter a.</p>

<p>Using non-greedy repetition may not always produce the results you expect. Consider the pattern /a+b/, which matches one or more a’s, followed by the letter b. When applied to the string “aaab”, it matches the entire string. Now let’s use the non-greedy version: /a+?b/. This should match the letter b preceded by the fewest number of a’s possible. When applied to the same string “aaab”, you might expect it to match only one a and the last letter b. In fact, however, this pattern matches the entire string, just like the greedy version of the pattern. This is because regular expression pattern matching is done by finding the first position in the string at which a match is possible. Since a match is possible starting at the first character of the string, shorter matches starting at subsequent characters are never even considered.</p>

<h4 id="toc_15">ALTERNATION, GROUPING, AND REFERENCES</h4>

<p>The regular expression grammar includes special characters for specifying alternatives, grouping subexpressions, and referring to previous subexpressions. The | character separates alternatives. For example, <code>/ab|cd|ef/</code> matches the string “ab” or the string “cd” or the string “ef”. And <code>/\d{3}|[a-z]{4}/</code>matches either three digits or four lowercase letters.</p>

<p>Note that alternatives are considered left to right until a match is found. If the left alternative matches, the right alternative is ignored, even if it would have produced a “better” match. Thus, when the pattern <code>/a|ab/</code> is applied to the string “ab”, it matches only the first letter.</p>

<p>Parentheses have several purposes in regular expressions. One purpose is to group separate items into a single subexpression so that the items can be treated as a single unit by <code>|, *, +, ?,</code> and so on. For example, <code>/java(script)?/</code> matches “java” followed by the optional “script”. And <code>/(ab|cd)+|ef/</code> matches either the string “ef” or one or more repetitions of either of the strings “ab” or “cd”.</p>

<p>Another purpose of parentheses in regular expressions is to define subpatterns within the complete pattern. When a regular expression is successfully matched against a target string, it is possible to extract the portions of the target string that matched any particular parenthesized subpattern. (You’ll see how these matching substrings are obtained later in this section.) For example, suppose you are looking for one or more lowercase letters followed by one or more digits. You might use the pattern <code>/[a-z]+\d+/</code>. But suppose you only really care about the digits at the end of each match. If you put that part of the pattern in parentheses (<code>/[a-z]+(\d+)/</code>), you can extract the digits from any matches you find, as explained later.</p>

<p>A related use of parenthesized subexpressions is to allow you to refer back to a subexpression later in the same regular expression. This is done by following a <code>\</code> character by a digit or digits. The digits refer to the position of the parenthesized subexpression within the regular expression. For example, <code>\1</code> refers back to the first subexpression, and <code>\3</code> refers to the third. Note that, because subexpressions can be nested within others, it is the position of the left parenthesis that is counted. In the following regular expression, for example, the nested subexpression <code>([Ss]cript)</code> is referred to as <code>\2</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">/([Jj]ava([Ss]cript)?)\sis\s(fun\w*)/
</code></pre>

<p>A reference to a previous subexpression of a regular expression does not refer to the pattern for that subexpression but rather to the text that matched the pattern. Thus, references can be used to enforce a constraint that separate portions of a string contain exactly the same characters. For example, the following regular expression matches zero or more characters within single or double quotes. However, it does not require the opening and closing quotes to match (i.e., both single quotes or both double quotes):</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">/[&#39;&quot;][^&#39;&quot;]*[&#39;&quot;]/
</code></pre>

<p>To require the quotes to match, use a reference:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">/([&#39;&quot;])[^&#39;&quot;]*\1/
</code></pre>

<p>The \1 matches whatever the first parenthesized subexpression matched. In this example, it enforces the constraint that the closing quote match the opening quote. This regular expression does not allow single quotes within double-quoted strings or vice versa. (It is not legal to use a reference within a character class, so you cannot write: <code>/([&#39;&quot;])[^\1]*\1/</code>.)</p>

<p>When we cover the RegExp API later, you’ll see that this kind of reference to a parenthesized subexpression is a powerful feature of regular-expression search-and-replace operations.</p>

<p>It is also possible to group items in a regular expression without creating a numbered reference to those items. Instead of simply grouping the items within ( and ), begin the group with (?: and end it with ). Consider the following pattern:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">/([Jj]ava(?:[Ss]cript)?)\sis\s(fun\w*)/
</code></pre>

<p>In this example, the subexpression <code>(?:[Ss]cript)</code> is used simply for grouping, so the ? repetition character can be applied to the group. These modified parentheses do not produce a reference, so in this regular expression, <code>\2</code> refers to the text matched by <code>(fun\w*)</code>.</p>

<p>Table 11-4 summarizes the regular expression alternation, grouping, and referencing operators.</p>

<p>Table 11-4. Regular expression alternation, grouping, and reference characters<br/>
Character   Meaning<br/>
|</p>

<p>Alternation: match either the subexpression to the left or the subexpression to the right.</p>

<p>(...)</p>

<p>Grouping: group items into a single unit that can be used with *, +, ?, |, and so on. Also remember the characters that match this group for use with later references.</p>

<p>(?:...)</p>

<p>Grouping only: group items into a single unit, but do not remember the characters that match this group.</p>

<p>\n</p>

<p>Match the same characters that were matched when group number n was first matched. Groups are subexpressions within (possibly nested) parentheses. Group numbers are assigned by counting left parentheses from left to right. Groups formed with (?: are not numbered.</p>

<p>NAMED CAPTURE GROUPS<br/>
ES2018 standardizes a new feature that can make regular expressions more self-documenting and easier to understand. This new feature is known as “named capture groups” and it allows us to associate a name with each left parenthesis in a regular expression so that we can refer to the matching text by name rather than by number. Equally important: using names allows someone reading the code to more easily understand the purpose of that portion of the regular expression. As of early 2020, this feature is implemented in Node, Chrome, Edge, and Safari, but not yet by Firefox.</p>

<p>To name a group, use (?&lt;...&gt; instead of ( and put the name between the angle brackets. For example, here is a regular expression that might be used to check the formatting of the final line of a US mailing address:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">/(?&lt;city&gt;\w+) (?&lt;state&gt;[A-Z]{2}) (?&lt;zipcode&gt;\d{5})(?&lt;zip9&gt;-\d{4})?/
</code></pre>

<p>Notice how much context the group names provide to make the regular expression easier to understand. In §11.3.2, when we discuss the String replace() and match() methods and the RegExp exec() method, you’ll see how the RegExp API allows you to refer to the text that matches each of these groups by name rather than by position.</p>

<p>If you want to refer back to a named capture group within a regular expression, you can do that by name as well. In the preceding example, we were able to use a regular expression “backreference” to write a RegExp that would match a single- or double-quoted string where the open and close quotes had to match. We could rewrite this RegExp using a named capturing group and a named backreference like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">/(?&lt;quote&gt;[&#39;&quot;])[^&#39;&quot;]*\k&lt;quote&gt;/
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>\k&lt;quote&gt;</code> is a named backreference to the named group that captures the open quotation mark.</p>

<p>SPECIFYING MATCH POSITION<br/>
As described earlier, many elements of a regular expression match a single character in a string. For example, \s matches a single character of whitespace. Other regular expression elements match the positions between characters instead of actual characters. \b, for example, matches an ASCII word boundary—the boundary between a \w (ASCII word character) and a \W (nonword character), or the boundary between an ASCII word character and the beginning or end of a string.4 Elements such as \b do not specify any characters to be used in a matched string; what they do specify, however, are legal positions at which a match can occur. Sometimes these elements are called regular expression anchors because they anchor the pattern to a specific position in the search string. The most commonly used anchor elements are <sup>,</sup> which ties the pattern to the beginning of the string, and $, which anchors the pattern to the end of the string.</p>

<p>For example, to match the word “JavaScript” on a line by itself, you can use the regular expression /<sup>JavaScript$/.</sup> If you want to search for “Java” as a word by itself (not as a prefix, as it is in “JavaScript”), you can try the pattern /\sJava\s/, which requires a space before and after the word. But there are two problems with this solution. First, it does not match “Java” at the beginning or the end of a string, but only if it appears with space on either side. Second, when this pattern does find a match, the matched string it returns has leading and trailing spaces, which is not quite what’s needed. So instead of matching actual space characters with \s, match (or anchor to) word boundaries with \b. The resulting expression is /\bJava\b/. The element \B anchors the match to a location that is not a word boundary. Thus, the pattern <code>/\B[Ss]cript/</code> matches “JavaScript” and “postscript”, but not “script” or “Scripting”.</p>

<p>You can also use arbitrary regular expressions as anchor conditions. If you include an expression within (?= and ) characters, it is a lookahead assertion, and it specifies that the enclosed characters must match, without actually matching them. For example, to match the name of a common programming language, but only if it is followed by a colon, you could use <code>/[Jj]ava([Ss]cript)?(?=\:)/</code>. This pattern matches the word “JavaScript” in “JavaScript: The Definitive Guide”, but it does not match “Java” in “Java in a Nutshell” because it is not followed by a colon.</p>

<p>If you instead introduce an assertion with (?!, it is a negative lookahead assertion, which specifies that the following characters must not match. For example, <code>/Java(?!Script)([A-Z]\w*)/</code> matches “Java” followed by a capital letter and any number of additional ASCII word characters, as long as “Java” is not followed by “Script”. It matches “JavaBeans” but not “Javanese”, and it matches “JavaScrip” but not “JavaScript” or “JavaScripter”. Table 11-5 summarizes regular expression anchors.</p>

<p>Table 11-5. Regular expression anchor characters<br/>
Character   Meaning<br/>
^</p>

<p>Match the beginning of the string or, with the m flag, the beginning of a line.</p>

<p>$</p>

<p>Match the end of the string and, with the m flag, the end of a line.</p>

<p>\b</p>

<p>Match a word boundary. That is, match the position between a \w character and a \W character or between a \w character and the beginning or end of a string. (Note, however, that [\b] matches backspace.)</p>

<p>\B</p>

<p>Match a position that is not a word boundary.</p>

<p>(?=p)</p>

<p>A positive lookahead assertion. Require that the following characters match the pattern p, but do not include those characters in the match.</p>

<p>(?!p)</p>

<p>A negative lookahead assertion. Require that the following characters do not match the pattern p.</p>

<h4 id="toc_16">LOOKBEHIND ASSERTIONS</h4>

<p>ES2018 extends regular expression syntax to allow “lookbehind” assertions. These are like lookahead assertions but refer to text before the current match position. As of early 2020, these are implemented in Node, Chrome, and Edge, but not Firefox or Safari.</p>

<p>Specify a positive lookbehind assertion with (?&lt;=...) and a negative lookbehind assertion with (?&lt;!...). For example, if you were working with US mailing addresses, you could match a 5-digit zip code, but only when it follows a two-letter state abbreviation, like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">/(?&lt;= [A-Z]{2} )\d{5}/
</code></pre>

<p>And you could match a string of digits that is not preceded by a Unicode currency symbol with a negative lookbehind assertion like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">/(?&lt;![\p{Currency_Symbol}\d.])\d+(\.\d+)?/u
</code></pre>

<h4 id="toc_17">FLAGS</h4>

<p>Every regular expression can have one or more flags associated with it to alter its matching behavior. JavaScript defines six possible flags, each of which is represented by a single letter. Flags are specified after the second / character of a regular expression literal or as a string passed as the second argument to the RegExp() constructor. The supported flags and their meanings are:</p>

<p>g<br/>
The g flag indicates that the regular expression is “global”—that is, that we intend to use it to find all matches within a string rather than just finding the first match. This flag does not alter the way that pattern matching is done, but, as we’ll see later, it does alter the behavior of the String match() method and the RegExp exec() method in important ways.</p>

<p>i<br/>
The i flag specifies that pattern matching should be case-insensitive.</p>

<p>m<br/>
The m flag specifies that matching should be done in “multiline” mode. It says that the RegExp will be used with multiline strings and that the ^ and $ anchors should match both the beginning and end of the string and also the beginning and end of individual lines within the string.</p>

<p>s<br/>
Like the m flag, the s flag is also useful when working with text that includes newlines. Normally, a “.” in a regular expression matches any character except a line terminator. When the s flag is used, however, “.” will match any character, including line terminators. The s flag was added to JavaScript in ES2018 and, as of early 2020, is supported in Node, Chrome, Edge, and Safari, but not Firefox.</p>

<p>u<br/>
The u flag stands for Unicode, and it makes the regular expression match full Unicode codepoints rather than matching 16-bit values. This flag was introduced in ES6, and you should make a habit of using it on all regular expressions unless you have some reason not to. If you do not use this flag, then your RegExps will not work well with text that includes emoji and other characters (including many Chinese characters) that require more than 16 bits. Without the u flag, the “.” character matches any 1 UTF-16 16-bit value. With the flag, however, “.” matches one Unicode codepoint, including those that have more than 16 bits. Setting the u flag on a RegExp also allows you to use the new \u{...} escape sequence for Unicode character and also enables the \p{...} notation for Unicode character classes.</p>

<p>y<br/>
The y flag indicates that the regular expression is “sticky” and should match at the beginning of a string or at the first character following the previous match. When used with a regular expression that is designed to find a single match, it effectively treats that regular expression as if it begins with ^ to anchor it to the beginning of the string. This flag is more useful with regular expressions that are used repeatedly to find all matches within a string. In this case, it causes special behavior of the String match() method and the RegExp exec() method to enforce that each subsequent match is anchored to the string position at which the last one ended.</p>

<p>These flags may be specified in any combination and in any order. For example, if you want your regular expression to be Unicode-aware to do case-insensitive matching and you intend to use it to find multiple matches within a string, you would specify the flags uig, gui, or any other permutation of these three letters.</p>

<h3 id="toc_18">11.3.2 String Methods for Pattern Matching</h3>

<p>Until now, we have been describing the grammar used to define regular expressions, but not explaining how those regular expressions can actually be used in JavaScript code. We are now switching to cover the API for using RegExp objects. This section begins by explaining the string methods that use regular expressions to perform pattern matching and search-and-replace operations. The sections that follow this one continue the discussion of pattern matching with JavaScript regular expressions by discussing the RegExp object and its methods and properties.</p>

<p>SEARCH()<br/>
Strings support four methods that use regular expressions. The simplest is search(). This method takes a regular expression argument and returns either the character position of the start of the first matching substring or −1 if there is no match:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">&quot;JavaScript&quot;.search(/script/ui)  // =&gt; 4
&quot;Python&quot;.search(/script/ui)      // =&gt; -1
</code></pre>

<p>If the argument to search() is not a regular expression, it is first converted to one by passing it to the RegExp constructor. search() does not support global searches; it ignores the g flag of its regular expression argument.</p>

<p>REPLACE()<br/>
The replace() method performs a search-and-replace operation. It takes a regular expression as its first argument and a replacement string as its second argument. It searches the string on which it is called for matches with the specified pattern. If the regular expression has the g flag set, the replace() method replaces all matches in the string with the replacement string; otherwise, it replaces only the first match it finds. If the first argument to replace() is a string rather than a regular expression, the method searches for that string literally rather than converting it to a regular expression with the RegExp() constructor, as search() does. As an example, you can use replace() as follows to provide uniform capitalization of the word “JavaScript” throughout a string of text:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">// No matter how it is capitalized, replace it with the correct capitalization
text.replace(/javascript/gi, &quot;JavaScript&quot;);
</code></pre>

<p>replace() is more powerful than this, however. Recall that parenthesized subexpressions of a regular expression are numbered from left to right and that the regular expression remembers the text that each subexpression matches. If a $ followed by a digit appears in the replacement string, replace() replaces those two characters with the text that matches the specified subexpression. This is a very useful feature. You can use it, for example, to replace quotation marks in a string with other characters:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">// A quote is a quotation mark, followed by any number of
// nonquotation mark characters (which we capture), followed
// by another quotation mark.
let quote = /&quot;([^&quot;]*)&quot;/g;
// Replace the straight quotation marks with guillemets
// leaving the quoted text (stored in $1) unchanged.
&#39;He said &quot;stop&quot;&#39;.replace(quote, &#39;«$1»&#39;)  // =&gt; &#39;He said «stop»&#39;
</code></pre>

<p>If your RegExp uses named capture groups, then you can refer to the matching text by name rather than by number:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">let quote = /&quot;(?&lt;quotedText&gt;[^&quot;]*)&quot;/g;
&#39;He said &quot;stop&quot;&#39;.replace(quote, &#39;«$&lt;quotedText&gt;»&#39;)  // =&gt; &#39;He said «stop»&#39;
</code></pre>

<p>Instead of passing a replacement string as the second argument to replace(), you can also pass a function that will be invoked to compute the replacement value. The replacement function is invoked with a number of arguments. First is the entire matched text. Next, if the RegExp has capturing groups, then the substrings that were captured by those groups are passed as arguments. The next argument is the position within the string at which the match was found. After that, the entire string that replace() was called on is passed. And finally, if the RegExp contained any named capture groups, the last argument to the replacement function is an object whose property names match the capture group names and whose values are the matching text. As an example, here is code that uses a replacement function to convert decimal integers in a string to hexadecimal:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">let s = &quot;15 times 15 is 225&quot;;
s.replace(/\d+/gu, n =&gt; parseInt(n).toString(16))  // =&gt; &quot;f times f is e1&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>MATCH()<br/>
The match() method is the most general of the String regular expression methods. It takes a regular expression as its only argument (or converts its argument to a regular expression by passing it to the RegExp() constructor) and returns an array that contains the results of the match, or null if no match is found. If the regular expression has the g flag set, the method returns an array of all matches that appear in the string. For example:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">&quot;7 plus 8 equals 15&quot;.match(/\d+/g)  // =&gt; [&quot;7&quot;, &quot;8&quot;, &quot;15&quot;]
</code></pre>

<p>If the regular expression does not have the g flag set, match() does not do a global search; it simply searches for the first match. In this nonglobal case, match() still returns an array, but the array elements are completely different. Without the g flag, the first element of the returned array is the matching string, and any remaining elements are the substrings matching the parenthesized capturing groups of the regular expression. Thus, if match() returns an array a, a[0] contains the complete match, a[1] contains the substring that matched the first parenthesized expression, and so on. To draw a parallel with the replace() method, a[1] is the same string as \(1, a[2] is the same as \)2, and so on.</p>

<p>For example, consider parsing a URL5 with the following code:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">// A very simple URL parsing RegExp
let url = /(\w+):\/\/([\w.]+)\/(\S*)/;
let text = &quot;Visit my blog at http://www.example.com/~david&quot;;
let match = text.match(url);
let fullurl, protocol, host, path;
if (match !== null) {
    fullurl = match[0];   // fullurl == &quot;http://www.example.com/~david&quot;
    protocol = match[1];  // protocol == &quot;http&quot;
    host = match[2];      // host == &quot;www.example.com&quot;
    path = match[3];      // path == &quot;~david&quot;
}
</code></pre>

<p>In this non-global case, the array returned by match() also has some object properties in addition to the numbered array elements. The input property refers to the string on which match() was called. The index property is the position within that string at which the match starts. And if the regular expression contains named capture groups, then the returned array also has a groups property whose value is an object. The properties of this object match the names of the named groups, and the values are the matching text. We could rewrite the previous URL parsing example, for example, like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">let url = /(?&lt;protocol&gt;\w+):\/\/(?&lt;host&gt;[\w.]+)\/(?&lt;path&gt;\S*)/;
let text = &quot;Visit my blog at http://www.example.com/~david&quot;;
let match = text.match(url);
match[0]               // =&gt; &quot;http://www.example.com/~david&quot;
match.input            // =&gt; text
match.index            // =&gt; 17
match.groups.protocol  // =&gt; &quot;http&quot;
match.groups.host      // =&gt; &quot;www.example.com&quot;
match.groups.path      // =&gt; &quot;~david&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>We’ve seen that match() behaves quite differently depending on whether the RegExp has the g flag set or not. There are also important but less dramatic differences in behavior when the y flag is set. Recall that the y flag makes a regular expression “sticky” by constraining where in the string matches can begin. If a RegExp has both the g and y flags set, then match() returns an array of matched strings, just as it does when g is set without y. But the first match must begin at the start of the string, and each subsequent match must begin at the character immediately following the previous match.</p>

<p>If the y flag is set without g, then match() tries to find a single match, and, by default, this match is constrained to the start of the string. You can change this default match start position, however, by setting the lastIndex property of the RegExp object at the index at which you want to match at. If a match is found, then this lastIndex will be automatically updated to the first character after the match, so if you call match() again, in this case, it will look for a subsequent match. (lastIndex may seem like a strange name for a property that specifies the position at which to begin the next match. We will see it again when we cover the RegExp exec() method, and its name may make more sense in that context.)</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">let vowel = /[aeiou]/y;  // Sticky vowel match
&quot;test&quot;.match(vowel)      // =&gt; null: &quot;test&quot; does not begin with a vowel
vowel.lastIndex = 1;     // Specify a different match position
&quot;test&quot;.match(vowel)[0]   // =&gt; &quot;e&quot;: we found a vowel at position 1
vowel.lastIndex          // =&gt; 2: lastIndex was automatically updated
&quot;test&quot;.match(vowel)      // =&gt; null: no vowel at position 2
vowel.lastIndex          // =&gt; 0: lastIndex gets reset after failed match
</code></pre>

<p>It is worth noting that passing a non-global regular expression to the match() method of a string is the same as passing the string to the exec() method of the regular expression: the returned array and its properties are the same in both cases.</p>

<p>MATCHALL()<br/>
The matchAll() method is defined in ES2020, and as of early 2020 is implemented by modern web browsers and Node. matchAll() expects a RegExp with the g flag set. Instead of returning an array of matching substrings like match() does, however, it returns an iterator that yields the kind of match objects that match() returns when used with a non-global RegExp. This makes matchAll() the easiest and most general way to loop through all matches within a string.</p>

<p>You might use matchAll() to loop through the words in a string of text like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">// One or more Unicode alphabetic characters between word boundaries
const words = /\b\p{Alphabetic}+\b/gu; // \p is not supported in Firefox yet
const text = &quot;This is a naïve test of the matchAll() method.&quot;;
for(let word of text.matchAll(words)) {
    console.log(`Found &#39;${word[0]}&#39; at index ${word.index}.`);
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can set the lastIndex property of a RegExp object to tell matchAll() what index in the string to begin matching at. Unlike the other pattern-matching methods, however, matchAll() never modifies the lastIndex property of the RegExp you call it on, and this makes it much less likely to cause bugs in your code.</p>

<p>SPLIT()<br/>
The last of the regular expression methods of the String object is split(). This method breaks the string on which it is called into an array of substrings, using the argument as a separator. It can be used with a string argument like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">&quot;123,456,789&quot;.split(&quot;,&quot;)           // =&gt; [&quot;123&quot;, &quot;456&quot;, &quot;789&quot;]
</code></pre>

<p>The split() method can also take a regular expression as its argument, and this allows you to specify more general separators. Here we call it with a separator that includes an arbitrary amount of whitespace on either side:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">&quot;1, 2, 3,\n4, 5&quot;.split(/\s*,\s*/)  // =&gt; [&quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;4&quot;, &quot;5&quot;]
</code></pre>

<p>Surprisingly, if you call split() with a RegExp delimiter and the regular expression includes capturing groups, then the text that matches the capturing groups will be included in the returned array. For example:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">const htmlTag = /&lt;([^&gt;]+)&gt;/;  // &lt; followed by one or more non-&gt;, followed by &gt;
&quot;Testing&lt;br/&gt;1,2,3&quot;.split(htmlTag)  // =&gt; [&quot;Testing&quot;, &quot;br/&quot;, &quot;1,2,3&quot;]
</code></pre>

<h3 id="toc_19">11.3.3 The RegExp Class</h3>

<p>This section documents the RegExp() constructor, the properties of RegExp instances, and two important pattern-matching methods defined by the RegExp class.</p>

<p>The RegExp() constructor takes one or two string arguments and creates a new RegExp object. The first argument to this constructor is a string that contains the body of the regular expression—the text that would appear within slashes in a regular-expression literal. Note that both string literals and regular expressions use the \ character for escape sequences, so when you pass a regular expression to RegExp() as a string literal, you must replace each \ character with \. The second argument to RegExp() is optional. If supplied, it indicates the regular expression flags. It should be g, i, m, s, u, y, or any combination of those letters.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">// Find all five-digit numbers in a string. Note the double \\ in this case.
let zipcode = new RegExp(&quot;\\d{5}&quot;, &quot;g&quot;);
</code></pre>

<p>The RegExp() constructor is useful when a regular expression is being dynamically created and thus cannot be represented with the regular expression literal syntax. For example, to search for a string entered by the user, a regular expression must be created at runtime with RegExp().</p>

<p>Instead of passing a string as the first argument to RegExp(), you can also pass a RegExp object. This allows you to copy a regular expression and change its flags:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">let exactMatch = /JavaScript/;
let caseInsensitive = new RegExp(exactMatch, &quot;i&quot;);
</code></pre>

<h4 id="toc_20">REGEXP PROPERTIES</h4>

<p>RegExp objects have the following properties:</p>

<p>source<br/>
This read-only property is the source text of the regular expression: the characters that appear between the slashes in a RegExp literal.</p>

<p>flags<br/>
This read-only property is a string that specifies the set of letters that represent the flags for the RegExp.</p>

<p>global<br/>
A read-only boolean property that is true if the g flag is set.</p>

<p>ignoreCase<br/>
A read-only boolean property that is true if the i flag is set.</p>

<p>multiline<br/>
A read-only boolean property that is true if the m flag is set.</p>

<p>dotAll<br/>
A read-only boolean property that is true if the s flag is set.</p>

<p>unicode<br/>
A read-only boolean property that is true if the u flag is set.</p>

<p>sticky<br/>
A read-only boolean property that is true if the y flag is set.</p>

<p>lastIndex<br/>
This property is a read/write integer. For patterns with the g or y flags, it specifies the character position at which the next search is to begin. It is used by the exec() and test() methods, described in the next two subsections.</p>

<p>TEST()<br/>
The test() method of the RegExp class is the simplest way to use a regular expression. It takes a single string argument and returns true if the string matches the pattern or false if it does not match.</p>

<p>test() works by simply calling the (much more complicated) exec() method described in the next section and returning true if exec() returns a non-null value. Because of this, if you use test() with a RegExp that uses the g or y flags, then its behavior depends on the value of the lastIndex property of the RegExp object, which can change unexpectedly. See “The lastIndex Property and RegExp Reuse” for more details.</p>

<p>EXEC()<br/>
The RegExp exec() method is the most general and powerful way to use regular expressions. It takes a single string argument and looks for a match in that string. If no match is found, it returns null. If a match is found, however, it returns an array just like the array returned by the match() method for non-global searches. Element 0 of the array contains the string that matched the regular expression, and any subsequent array elements contain the substrings that matched any capturing groups. The returned array also has named properties: the index property contains the character position at which the match occurred, and the input property specifies the string that was searched, and the groups property, if defined, refers to an object that holds the substrings matching the any named capturing groups.</p>

<p>Unlike the String match() method, exec() returns the same kind of array whether or not the regular expression has the global g flag. Recall that match() returns an array of matches when passed a global regular expression. exec(), by contrast, always returns a single match and provides complete information about that match. When exec() is called on a regular expression that has either the global g flag or the sticky y flag set, it consults the lastIndex property of the RegExp object to determine where to start looking for a match. (And if the y flag is set, it also constrains the match to begin at that position.) For a newly created RegExp object, lastIndex is 0, and the search begins at the start of the string. But each time exec() successfully finds a match, it updates the lastIndex property to the index of the character immediately after the matched text. If exec() fails to find a match, it resets lastIndex to 0. This special behavior allows you to call exec() repeatedly in order to loop through all the regular expression matches in a string. (Although, as we’ve described, in ES2020 and later, the matchAll() method of String is an easier way to loop through all matches.) For example, the loop in the following code will run twice:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">let pattern = /Java/g;
let text = &quot;JavaScript &gt; Java&quot;;
let match;
while((match = pattern.exec(text)) !== null) {
    console.log(`Matched ${match[0]} at ${match.index}`);
    console.log(`Next search begins at ${pattern.lastIndex}`);
}
</code></pre>

<p>THE LASTINDEX PROPERTY AND REGEXP REUSE<br/>
As you have seen already, JavaScript’s regular expression API is complicated. The use of the lastIndex property with the g and y flags is a particularly awkward part of this API. When you use these flags, you need to be particularly careful when calling the match(), exec(), or test() methods because the behavior of these methods depends on lastIndex, and the value of lastIndex depends on what you have previously done with the RegExp object. This makes it easy to write buggy code.</p>

<p>Suppose, for example, that we wanted to find the index of all <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags within a string of HTML text. We might write code like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">let match, positions = [];
while((match = /&lt;p&gt;/g.exec(html)) !== null) { // POSSIBLE INFINITE LOOP
    positions.push(match.index);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This code does not do what we want it to. If the html string contains at least one <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag, then it will loop forever. The problem is that we use a RegExp literal in the while loop condition. For each iteration of the loop, we’re creating a new RegExp object with lastIndex set to 0, so exec() always begins at the start of the string, and if there is a match, it will keep matching over and over. The solution, of course, is to define the RegExp once, and save it to a variable so that we’re using the same RegExp object for each iteration of the loop.</p>

<p>On the other hand, sometimes reusing a RegExp object is the wrong thing to do. Suppose, for example, that we want to loop through all of the words in a dictionary to find words that contain pairs of double letters:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">let dictionary = [ &quot;apple&quot;, &quot;book&quot;, &quot;coffee&quot; ];
let doubleLetterWords = [];
let doubleLetter = /(\w)\1/g;

for(let word of dictionary) {
    if (doubleLetter.test(word)) {
        doubleLetterWords.push(word);
    }
}
doubleLetterWords  // =&gt; [&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;coffee&quot;]: &quot;book&quot; is missing!
</code></pre>

<p>Because we set the g flag on the RegExp, the lastIndex property is changed after successful matches, and the test() method (which is based on exec()) starts searching for a match at the position specified by lastIndex. After matching the “pp” in “apple”, lastIndex is 3, and so we start searching the word “book” at position 3 and do not see the “oo” that it contains.</p>

<p>We could fix this problem by removing the g flag (which is not actually necessary in this particular example), or by moving the RegExp literal into the body of the loop so that it is re-created on each iteration, or by explicitly resetting lastIndex to zero before each call to test().</p>

<p>The moral here is that lastIndex makes the RegExp API error prone. So be extra careful when using the g or y flags and looping. And in ES2020 and later, use the String matchAll() method instead of exec() to sidestep this problem since matchAll() does not modify lastIndex.</p>

<h2 id="toc_21">11.4 Dates and Times</h2>

<p>The Date class is JavaScript’s API for working with dates and times. Create a Date object with the Date() constructor. With no arguments, it returns a Date object that represents the current date and time:</p>

<p>If you pass one numeric argument, the Date() constructor interprets that argument as the number of milliseconds since the 1970 epoch:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>如果传递一个数字实参，则 Date() 构造函数将该参数解释为自 1970 年以来的毫秒数：</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">let epoch = new Date(0);  // Midnight, January 1st, 1970, GMT
</code></pre>

<p>If you specify two or more integer arguments, they are interpreted as the year, month, day-of-month, hour, minute, second, and millisecond in your local time zone, as in the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>如果指定两个或多个整数参数实参，则它们将被解释为本地时区中的年、月、日、小时、分钟、秒和毫秒，如下所示：</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">let century = new Date(2100,         // Year 2100
                       0,            // January
                       1,            // 1st
                       2, 3, 4, 5);  // 02:03:04.005, local time
</code></pre>

<p>One quirk of the Date API is that the first month of a year is number 0, but the first day of a month is number 1. If you omit the time fields, the Date() constructor defaults them all to 0, setting the time to midnight.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Date API 的一个怪癖是一年的第一个月是数字 0，而一个月的第一天是数字 1。如果省略了时间字段，则 Date() 构造函数会将它们全部默认为 0，并将时间设置为到午夜。</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that when invoked with multiple numbers, the Date() constructor interprets them using whatever time zone the local computer is set to. If you want to specify a date and time in UTC (Universal Coordinated Time, aka GMT), then you can use the Date.UTC(). This static method takes the same arguments as the Date() constructor, interprets them in UTC, and returns a millisecond timestamp that you can pass to the Date() constructor:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>请注意，当使用多个数字调用时，Date() 构造函数使用本地计算机设置为的时区解释它们。如果要以UTC（协调世界时，又称为GMT）指定日期和时间，则可以使用 Date.UTC()。 此静态方法采用与 Date() 构造函数相同的参数，以 UTC 解释它们，并返回可以传递给 Date() 构造函数的毫秒级时间戳：</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">// Midnight in England, January 1, 2100
let century = new Date(Date.UTC(2100, 0, 1));
</code></pre>

<p>If you print a date (with <code>console.log(century)</code>, for example), it will, by default, be printed in your local time zone. If you want to display a date in UTC, you should explicitly convert it to a string with toUTCString() or toISOString().</p>

<blockquote>
<p>如果您打印日期（例如，使用 <code>console.log(century)</code>），则默认情况下将在本地时区打印日期。 如果要以 UTC 显示日期，则应使用 toUTCString() 或 toISOString() 将其显式转换为字符串。</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Finally, if you pass a string to the Date() constructor, it will attempt to parse that string as a date and time specification. The constructor can parse dates specified in the formats produced by the toString(), toUTCString(), and toISOString() methods:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>最后，如果将字符串传递给 Date() 构造函数，它将尝试解析该字符串作为日期和时间规范。构造函数可以解析以 toString()、toUTCString() 和 toISOString() 方法产生的格式指定的日期：</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">let century = new Date(&quot;2100-01-01T00:00:00Z&quot;);  // An ISO format date
</code></pre>

<p>Once you have a Date object, various get and set methods allow you to query and modify the year, month, day-of-month, hour, minute, second, and millisecond fields of the Date. Each of these methods has two forms: one that gets or sets using local time and one that gets or sets using UTC time. To get or set the year of a Date object, for example, you would use getFullYear(), getUTCFullYear(), setFullYear(), or setUTCFullYear():</p>

<blockquote>
<p>有了 Date 对象后，可以使用各种 get 和 set 方法查询和修改日期的年、月、日、小时、分钟、秒和毫秒字段。这些方法中的每一种都有两种形式：一种使用本地时间获取或设置，另一种使用 UTC 时间获取或设置。例如，要获取或设置 Date 对象的年份，可以使用 getFullYear()、getUTCFullYear()、setFullYear() 或 setUTCFullYear()：</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">let d = new Date();                  // Start with the current date
d.setFullYear(d.getFullYear() + 1);  // Increment the year
</code></pre>

<p>To get or set the other fields of a Date, replace “FullYear” in the method name with “Month”, “Date”, “Hours”, “Minutes”, “Seconds”, or “Milliseconds”. Some of the date set methods allow you to set more than one field at a time. setFullYear() and setUTCFullYear() also optionally allow you to set the month and day-of-month as well. And setHours() and setUTCHours() allow you to specify the minutes, seconds, and milliseconds fields in addition to the hours field.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>要获取或设置日期的其他字段，请将方法名称中的“FullYear”替换为“Month”、“Date”、“Hours”、“Minutes”、“Seconds”或“Milliseconds”。一些日期设置方法可以一次设置多个字段。 setFullYear() 和 setUTCFullYear() 还可以选择设置月和日。setHours() 和 setUTCHours() 允许您除了指定小时数字段之外，还指定分钟，秒和毫秒字段。</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that the methods for querying the day-of-month are getDate() and getUTCDate(). The more natural-sounding functions getDay() and getUTCDay() return the day-of-week (0 for Sunday through 6 for Saturday). The day-of-week is read-only, so there is not a corresponding setDay() method.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>请注意，查询日期的方法是 getDate() 和 getUTCDate()。听起函数 getDay() 和 getUTCDay() 更像查询日期，但是它们返回星期几（ 0 为星期日，星期六为 6）。星期几是只读的，因此没有相应的 setDay() 方法。 </p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="toc_22">11.4.1 Timestamps</h3>

<p>JavaScript represents dates internally as integers that specify the number of milliseconds since (or before) midnight on January 1, 1970, UTC time. Integers as large as 8,640,000,000,000,000 are supported, so JavaScript won’t be running out of milliseconds for more than 270,000 years.</p>

<p>For any Date object, the getTime() method returns this internal value, and the setTime() method sets it. So you can add 30 seconds to a Date with code like this, for example:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">d.setTime(d.getTime() + 30000);
</code></pre>

<p>These millisecond values are sometimes called timestamps, and it is sometimes useful to work with them directly rather than with Date objects. The static Date.now() method returns the current time as a timestamp and is helpful when you want to measure how long your code takes to run:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">let startTime = Date.now();
reticulateSplines(); // Do some time-consuming operation
let endTime = Date.now();
console.log(`Spline reticulation took ${endTime - startTime}ms.`);
</code></pre>

<h4 id="toc_23">HIGH-RESOLUTION TIMESTAMPS</h4>

<p>The timestamps returned by Date.now() are measured in milliseconds. A millisecond is actually a relatively long time for a computer, and sometimes you may want to measure elapsed time with higher precision. The performance.now() function allows this: it also returns a millisecond-based timestamp, but the return value is not an integer, so it includes fractions of a millisecond. The value returned by performance.now() is not an absolute timestamp like the Date.now() value is. Instead, it simply indicates how much time has elapsed since a web page was loaded or since the Node process started.</p>

<p>The performance object is part of a larger Performance API that is not defined by the ECMAScript standard but is implemented by web browsers and by Node. In order to use the performance object in Node, you must import it with:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">const { performance } = require(&quot;perf_hooks&quot;);
</code></pre>

<p>Allowing high-precision timing on the web may allow unscrupulous websites to fingerprint visitors, so browsers (notably Firefox) may reduce the precision of performance.now() by default. As a web developer, you should be able to re-enable high-precision timing somehow (such as by setting privacy.reduceTimerPrecision to false in Firefox).</p>

<h3 id="toc_24">11.4.2 Date Arithmetic</h3>

<p>Date objects can be compared with JavaScript’s standard <code>&lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, and &gt;=</code> comparison operators. And you can subtract one Date object from another to determine the number of milliseconds between the two dates. (This works because the Date class defines a valueOf() method that returns a timestamp.)</p>

<p>If you want to add or subtract a specified number of seconds, minutes, or hours from a Date, it is often easiest to simply modify the timestamp as demonstrated in the previous example, when we added 30 seconds to a date. This technique becomes more cumbersome if you want to add days, and it does not work at all for months and years since they have varying numbers of days. To do date arithmetic involving days, months, and years, you can use setDate(), setMonth(), and setYear(). Here, for example, is code that adds three months and two weeks to the current date:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">let d = new Date();
d.setMonth(d.getMonth() + 3, d.getDate() + 14);
</code></pre>

<p>Date setting methods work correctly even when they overflow. When we add three months to the current month, we can end up with a value greater than 11 (which represents December). The setMonth() handles this by incrementing the year as needed. Similarly, when we set the day of the month to a value larger than the number of days in the month, the month gets incremented appropriately.</p>

<h3 id="toc_25">11.4.3 Formatting and Parsing Date Strings</h3>

<p>If you are using the Date class to actually keep track of dates and times (as opposed to just measuring time intervals), then you are likely to need to display dates and times to the users of your code. The Date class defines a number of different methods for converting Date objects to strings. Here are some examples:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">let d = new Date(2020, 0, 1, 17, 10, 30); // 5:10:30pm on New Year&#39;s Day 2020
d.toString()  // =&gt; &quot;Wed Jan 01 2020 17:10:30 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time)&quot;
d.toUTCString()         // =&gt; &quot;Thu, 02 Jan 2020 01:10:30 GMT&quot;
d.toLocaleDateString()  // =&gt; &quot;1/1/2020&quot;: &#39;en-US&#39; locale
d.toLocaleTimeString()  // =&gt; &quot;5:10:30 PM&quot;: &#39;en-US&#39; locale
d.toISOString()         // =&gt; &quot;2020-01-02T01:10:30.000Z&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>This is a full list of the string formatting methods of the Date class:</p>

<p>toString()<br/>
This method uses the local time zone but does not format the date and time in a locale-aware way.</p>

<p>toUTCString()<br/>
This method uses the UTC time zone but does not format the date in a locale-aware way.</p>

<p>toISOString()<br/>
This method prints the date and time in the standard year-month-day hours:minutes:seconds.ms format of the ISO-8601 standard. The letter “T” separates the date portion of the output from the time portion of the output. The time is expressed in UTC, and this is indicated with the letter “Z” as the last letter of the output.</p>

<p>toLocaleString()<br/>
This method uses the local time zone and a format that is appropriate for the user’s locale.</p>

<p>toDateString()<br/>
This method formats only the date portion of the Date and omits the time. It uses the local time zone and does not do locale-appropriate formatting.</p>

<p>toLocaleDateString()<br/>
This method formats only the date. It uses the local time zone and a locale-appropriate date format.</p>

<p>toTimeString()<br/>
This method formats only the time and omits the date. It uses the local time zone but does not format the time in a locale-aware way.</p>

<p>toLocaleTimeString()<br/>
This method formats the time in a locale-aware way and uses the local time zone.</p>

<p>None of these date-to-string methods is ideal when formatting dates and times to be displayed to end users. See §11.7.2 for a more general-purpose and locale-aware date- and time-formatting technique.</p>

<p>Finally, in addition to these methods that convert a Date object to a string, there is also a static Date.parse() method that takes a string as its argument, attempts to parse it as a date and time, and returns a timestamp representing that date. Date.parse() is able to parse the same strings that the Date() constructor can and is guaranteed to be able to parse the output of toISOString(), toUTCString(), and toString().</p>

<h2 id="toc_26">11.5 Error Classes</h2>

<p>The JavaScript throw and catch statements can throw and catch any JavaScript value, including primitive values. There is no exception type that must be used to signal errors. JavaScript does define an Error class, however, and it is traditional to use instances of Error or a subclass when signaling an error with throw. One good reason to use an Error object is that, when you create an Error, it captures the state of the JavaScript stack, and if the exception is uncaught, the stack trace will be displayed with the error message, which will help you debug the issue. (Note that the stack trace shows where the Error object was created, not where the throw statement throws it. If you always create the object right before throwing it with throw new Error(), this will not cause any confusion.)</p>

<p>Error objects have two properties: message and name, and a toString() method. The value of the message property is the value you passed to the Error() constructor, converted to a string if necessary. For error objects created with Error(), the name property is always “Error”. The toString() method simply returns the value of the name property followed by a colon and space and the value of the message property.</p>

<p>Although it is not part of the ECMAScript standard, Node and all modern browsers also define a stack property on Error objects. The value of this property is a multi-line string that contains a stack trace of the JavaScript call stack at the moment that the Error object was created. This can be useful information to log when an unexpected error is caught.</p>

<p>In addition to the Error class, JavaScript defines a number of subclasses that it uses to signal particular types of errors defined by ECMAScript. These subclasses are EvalError, RangeError, ReferenceError, SyntaxError, TypeError, and URIError. You can use these error classes in your own code if they seem appropriate. Like the base Error class, each of these subclasses has a constructor that takes a single message argument. And instances of each of these subclasses have a name property whose value is the same as the constructor name.</p>

<p>You should feel free to define your own Error subclasses that best encapsulate the error conditions of your own program. Note that you are not limited to the name and message properties. If you create a subclass, you can define new properties to provide error details. If you are writing a parser, for example, you might find it useful to define a ParseError class with line and column properties that specify the exact location of the parsing failure. Or if you are working with HTTP requests, you might want to define an HTTPError class that has a status property that holds the HTTP status code (such as 404 or 500) of the failed request.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">class HTTPError extends Error {
    constructor(status, statusText, url) {
        super(`${status} ${statusText}: ${url}`);
        this.status = status;
        this.statusText = statusText;
        this.url = url;
    }

    get name() { return &quot;HTTPError&quot;; }
}

let error = new HTTPError(404, &quot;Not Found&quot;, &quot;http://example.com/&quot;);
error.status        // =&gt; 404
error.message       // =&gt; &quot;404 Not Found: http://example.com/&quot;
error.name          // =&gt; &quot;HTTPError&quot;
</code></pre>

<h2 id="toc_27">11.6 JSON Serialization and Parsing</h2>

<p>When a program needs to save data or needs to transmit data across a network connection to another program, it must to convert its in-memory data structures into a string of bytes or characters than can be saved or transmitted and then later be parsed to restore the original in-memory data structures. This process of converting data structures into streams of bytes or characters is known as serialization (or marshaling or even pickling).</p>

<p>The easiest way to serialize data in JavaScript uses a serialization format known as JSON. This acronym stands for “JavaScript Object Notation” and, as the name implies, the format uses JavaScript object and array literal syntax to convert data structures consisting of objects and arrays into strings. JSON supports primitive numbers and strings and also the values true, false, and null, as well as arrays and objects built up from those primitive values. JSON does not support other JavaScript types like Map, Set, RegExp, Date, or typed arrays. Nevertheless, it has proved to be a remarkably versatile data format and is in common use even with non-JavaScript-based programs.</p>

<p>JavaScript supports JSON serialization and deserialization with the two functions JSON.stringify() and JSON.parse(), which were covered briefly in §6.8. Given an object or array (nested arbitrarily deeply) that does not contain any nonserializable values like RegExp objects or typed arrays, you can serialize the object simply by passing it to JSON.stringify(). As the name implies, the return value of this function is a string. And given a string returned by JSON.stringify(), you can re-create the original data structure by passing the string to JSON.parse():</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">let o = {s: &quot;&quot;, n: 0, a: [true, false, null]};
let s = JSON.stringify(o);  // s == &#39;{&quot;s&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;n&quot;:0,&quot;a&quot;:[true,false,null]}&#39;
let copy = JSON.parse(s);   // copy == {s: &quot;&quot;, n: 0, a: [true, false, null]}
</code></pre>

<p>If we leave out the part where serialized data is saved to a file or sent over the network, we can use this pair of functions as a somewhat inefficient way of creating a deep copy of an object:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">// Make a deep copy of any serializable object or array
function deepcopy(o) {
    return JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(o));
}
</code></pre>

<p>JSON IS A SUBSET OF JAVASCRIPT<br/>
When data is serialized to JSON format, the result is valid JavaScript source code for an expression that evaluates to a copy of the original data structure. If you prefix a JSON string with var data = and pass the result to eval(), you’ll get a copy of the original data structure assigned to the variable data. You should never do this, however, because it is a huge security hole—if an attacker could inject arbitrary JavaScript code into a JSON file, they could make your program run their code. It is faster and safer to just use JSON.parse() to decode JSON-formatted data.</p>

<p>JSON is sometimes used as a human-readable configuration file format. If you find yourself hand-editing a JSON file, note that the JSON format is a very strict subset of JavaScript. Comments are not allowed and property names must be enclosed in double quotes even when JavaScript would not require this.</p>

<p>Typically, you pass only a single argument to JSON.stringify() and JSON.parse(). Both functions accept an optional second argument that allows us to extend the JSON format, and these are described next. JSON.stringify() also takes an optional third argument that we’ll discuss first. If you would like your JSON-formatted string to be human-readable (if it is being used as a configuration file, for example), then you should pass null as the second argument and pass a number or string as the third argument. This third argument tells JSON.stringify() that it should format the data on multiple indented lines. If the third argument is a number, then it will use that number of spaces for each indentation level. If the third argument is a string of whitespace (such as &#39;\t&#39;), it will use that string for each level of indent.</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">let o = {s: &quot;test&quot;, n: 0};
JSON.stringify(o, null, 2)  // =&gt; &#39;{\n  &quot;s&quot;: &quot;test&quot;,\n  &quot;n&quot;: 0\n}&#39;
</code></pre>

<p>JSON.parse() ignores whitespace, so passing a third argument to JSON.stringify() has no impact on our ability to convert the string back into a data structure.</p>

<h3 id="toc_28">11.6.1 JSON Customizations</h3>

<p>If JSON.stringify() is asked to serialize a value that is not natively supported by the JSON format, it looks to see if that value has a toJSON() method, and if so, it calls that method and then stringifies the return value in place of the original value. Date objects implement toJSON(): it returns the same string that toISOString() method does. This means that if you serialize an object that includes a Date, the date will automatically be converted to a string for you. When you parse the serialized string, the re-created data structure will not be exactly the same as the one you started with because it will have a string where the original object had a Date.</p>

<p>If you need to re-create Date objects (or modify the parsed object in any other way), you can pass a “reviver” function as the second argument to JSON.parse(). If specified, this “reviver” function is invoked once for each primitive value (but not the objects or arrays that contain those primitive values) parsed from the input string. The function is invoked with two arguments. The first is a property name—either an object property name or an array index converted to a string. The second argument is the primitive value of that object property or array element. Furthermore, the function is invoked as a method of the object or array that contains the primitive value, so you can refer to that containing object with the this keyword.</p>

<p>The return value of the reviver function becomes the new value of the named property. If it returns its second argument, the property will remain unchanged. If it returns undefined, then the named property will be deleted from the object or array before JSON.parse() returns to the user.</p>

<p>As an example, here is a call to JSON.parse() that uses a reviver function to filter some properties and to re-create Date objects:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">let data = JSON.parse(text, function(key, value) {
    // Remove any values whose property name begins with an underscore
    if (key[0] === &quot;_&quot;) return undefined;

    // If the value is a string in ISO 8601 date format convert it to a Date.
    if (typeof value === &quot;string&quot; &amp;&amp;
        /^\d\d\d\d-\d\d-\d\dT\d\d:\d\d:\d\d.\d\d\dZ$/.test(value)) {
        return new Date(value);
    }

    // Otherwise, return the value unchanged
    return value;
});
</code></pre>

<p>In addition to its use of toJSON() described earlier, JSON.stringify() also allows its output to be customized by passing an array or a function as the optional second argument.</p>

<p>If an array of strings (or numbers—they are converted to strings) is passed instead as the second argument, these are used as the names of object properties (or array elements). Any property whose name is not in the array will be omitted from stringification. Furthermore, the returned string will include properties in the same order that they appear in the array (which can be very useful when writing tests).</p>

<p>If you pass a function, it is a replacer function—effectively the inverse of the optional reviver function you can pass to JSON.parse(). If specified, the replacer function is invoked for each value to be stringified. The first argument to the replacer function is the object property name or array index of the value within that object, and the second argument is the value itself. The replacer function is invoked as a method of the object or array that contains the value to be stringified. The return value of the replacer function is stringified in place of the original value. If the replacer returns undefined or returns nothing at all, then that value (and its array element or object property) is omitted from the stringification.</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">// Specify what fields to serialize, and what order to serialize them in
let text = JSON.stringify(address, [&quot;city&quot;,&quot;state&quot;,&quot;country&quot;]);

// Specify a replacer function that omits RegExp-value properties
let json = JSON.stringify(o, (k, v) =&gt; v instanceof RegExp ? undefined : v);
</code></pre>

<p>The two JSON.stringify() calls here use the second argument in a benign way, producing serialized output that can be deserialized without requiring a special reviver function. In general, though, if you define a toJSON() method for a type, or if you use a replacer function that actually replaces nonserializable values with serializable ones, then you will typically need to use a custom reviver function with JSON.parse() to get your original data structure back. If you do this, you should understand that you are defining a custom data format and sacrificing portability and compatibility with a large ecosystem of JSON-compatible tools and languages.</p>

<h2 id="toc_29">11.7 The Internationalization API</h2>

<p>The JavaScript internationalization API consists of the three classes Intl.NumberFormat, Intl.DateTimeFormat, and Intl.Collator that allow us to format numbers (including monetary amounts and percentages), dates, and times in locale-appropriate ways and to compare strings in locale-appropriate ways. These classes are not part of the ECMAScript standard but are defined as part of the ECMA402 standard and are well-supported by web browsers. The Intl API is also supported in Node, but at the time of this writing, prebuilt Node binaries do not ship with the localization data required to make them work with locales other than US English. So in order to use these classes with Node, you may need to download a separate data package or use a custom build of Node.</p>

<p>One of the most important parts of internationalization is displaying text that has been translated into the user’s language. There are various ways to achieve this, but none of them are within the scope of the Intl API described here.</p>

<h3 id="toc_30">11.7.1 Formatting Numbers</h3>

<p>Users around the world expect numbers to be formatted in different ways. Decimal points can be periods or commas. Thousands separators can be commas or periods, and they aren’t used every three digits in all places. Some currencies are divided into hundredths, some into thousandths, and some have no subdivisions. Finally, although the so-called “Arabic numerals” 0 through 9 are used in many languages, this is not universal, and users in some countries will expect to see numbers written using the digits from their own scripts.</p>

<p>The Intl.NumberFormat class defines a format() method that takes all of these formatting possibilities into account. The constructor takes two arguments. The first argument specifies the locale that the number should be formatted for and the second is an object that specifies more details about how the number should be formatted. If the first argument is omitted or undefined, then the system locale (which we assume to be the user’s preferred locale) will be used. If the first argument is a string, it specifies a desired locale, such as &quot;en-US&quot; (English as used in the United States), &quot;fr&quot; (French), or &quot;zh-Hans-CN&quot; (Chinese, using the simplified Han writing system, in China). The first argument can also be an array of locale strings, and in this case, Intl.NumberFormat will choose the most specific one that is well supported.</p>

<p>The second argument to the Intl.NumberFormat() constructor, if specified, should be an object that defines one or more of the following properties:</p>

<p>style<br/>
Specifies the kind of number formatting that is required. The default is &quot;decimal&quot;. Specify &quot;percent&quot; to format a number as a percentage or specify &quot;currency&quot; to specify a number as an amount of money.</p>

<p>currency<br/>
If style is &quot;currency&quot;, then this property is required to specify the three-letter ISO currency code (such as &quot;USD&quot; for US dollars or &quot;GBP&quot; for British pounds) of the desired currency.</p>

<p>currencyDisplay<br/>
If style is &quot;currency&quot;, then this property specifies how the currency is displayed. The default value &quot;symbol&quot; uses a currency symbol if the currency has one. The value &quot;code&quot; uses the three-letter ISO code, and the value &quot;name&quot; spells out the name of the currency in long form.</p>

<p>useGrouping<br/>
Set this property to false if you do not want numbers to have thousands separators (or their locale-appropriate equivalents).</p>

<p>minimumIntegerDigits<br/>
The minimum number of digits to use to display the integer part of the number. If the number has fewer digits than this, it will be padded on the left with zeros. The default value is 1, but you can use values as high as 21.</p>

<p>minimumFractionDigits, maximumFractionDigits<br/>
These two properties control the formatting of the fractional part of the number. If a number has fewer fractional digits than the minimum, it will be padded with zeros on the right. If it has more than the maximum, then the fractional part will be rounded. Legal values for both properties are between 0 and 20. The default minimum is 0 and the default maximum is 3, except when formatting monetary amounts, when the length of the fractional part varies depending on the specified currency.</p>

<p>minimumSignificantDigits, maximumSignificantDigits<br/>
These properties control the number of significant digits used when formatting a number, making them suitable when formatting scientific data, for example. If specified, these properties override the integer and fractional digit properties listed previously. Legal values are between 1 and 21.</p>

<p>Once you have created an Intl.NumberFormat object with the desired locale and options, you use it by passing a number to its format() method, which returns an appropriately formatted string. For example:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">let euros = Intl.NumberFormat(&quot;es&quot;, {style: &quot;currency&quot;, currency: &quot;EUR&quot;});
euros.format(10)    // =&gt; &quot;10,00 €&quot;: ten euros, Spanish formatting

let pounds = Intl.NumberFormat(&quot;en&quot;, {style: &quot;currency&quot;, currency: &quot;GBP&quot;});
pounds.format(1000) // =&gt; &quot;£1,000.00&quot;: One thousand pounds, English formatting
</code></pre>

<p>A useful feature of Intl.NumberFormat (and the other Intl classes as well) is that its format() method is bound to the NumberFormat object to which it belongs. So instead of defining a variable that refers to the formatting object and then invoking the format() method on that, you can just assign the format() method to a variable and use it as if it were a standalone function, as in this example:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">let data = [0.05, .75, 1];
let formatData = Intl.NumberFormat(undefined, {
    style: &quot;percent&quot;,
    minimumFractionDigits: 1,
    maximumFractionDigits: 1
}).format;

data.map(formatData)   // =&gt; [&quot;5.0%&quot;, &quot;75.0%&quot;, &quot;100.0%&quot;]: in en-US locale
</code></pre>

<p>Some languages, such as Arabic, use their own script for decimal digits:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">let arabic = Intl.NumberFormat(&quot;ar&quot;, {useGrouping: false}).format;
arabic(1234567890)   // =&gt; &quot;١٢٣٤٥٦٧٨٩٠&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>Other languages, such as Hindi, use a script that has its own set of digits, but tend to use the ASCII digits 0–9 by default. If you want to override the default script used for digits, add -u-nu- to the locale and follow it with an abbreviated script name. You can format numbers with Indian-style grouping and Devanagari digits like this, for example:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">let hindi = Intl.NumberFormat(&quot;hi-IN-u-nu-deva&quot;).format;
hindi(1234567890)    // =&gt; &quot;१,२३,४५,६७,८९०&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>-u- in a locale specifies that what comes next is a Unicode extension. nu is the extension name for the numbering system, and deva is short for Devanagari. The Intl API standard defines names for a number of other numbering systems, mostly for the Indic languages of South and Southeast Asia.</p>

<h3 id="toc_31">11.7.2 Formatting Dates and Times</h3>

<p>The Intl.DateTimeFormat class is a lot like the Intl.NumberFormat class. The Intl.DateTimeFormat() constructor takes the same two arguments that Intl.NumberFormat() does: a locale or array of locales and an object of formatting options. And the way you use an Intl.DateTimeFormat instance is by calling its format() method to convert a Date object to a string.</p>

<p>As mentioned in §11.4, the Date class defines simple toLocaleDateString() and toLocaleTimeString() methods that produce locale-appropriate output for the user’s locale. But these methods don’t give you any control over what fields of the date and time are displayed. Maybe you want to omit the year but add a weekday to the date format. Do you want the month to be represented numerically or spelled out by name? The Intl.DateTimeFormat class provides fine-grained control over what is output based on the properties in the options object that is passed as the second argument to the constructor. Note, however, that Intl.DateTimeFormat cannot always display exactly what you ask for. If you specify options to format hours and seconds but omit minutes, you’ll find that the formatter displays the minutes anyway. The idea is that you use the options object to specify what date and time fields you’d like to present to the user and how you’d like those formatted (by name or by number, for example), then the formatter will look for a locale-appropriate format that most closely matches what you have asked for.</p>

<p>The available options are the following. Only specify properties for date and time fields that you would like to appear in the formatted output.</p>

<p>year<br/>
Use &quot;numeric&quot; for a full, four-digit year or &quot;2-digit&quot; for a two-digit abbreviation.</p>

<p>month<br/>
Use &quot;numeric&quot; for a possibly short number like “1”, or &quot;2-digit&quot; for a numeric representation that always has two digits, like “01”. Use &quot;long&quot; for a full name like “January”, &quot;short&quot; for an abbreviated name like “Jan”, and &quot;narrow&quot; for a highly abbreviated name like “J” that is not guaranteed to be unique.</p>

<p>day<br/>
Use &quot;numeric&quot; for a one- or two-digit number or &quot;2-digit&quot; for a two-digit number for the day-of-month.</p>

<p>weekday<br/>
Use &quot;long&quot; for a full name like “Monday”, &quot;short&quot; for an abbreviated name like “Mon”, and &quot;narrow&quot; for a highly abbreviated name like “M” that is not guaranteed to be unique.</p>

<p>era<br/>
This property specifies whether a date should be formatted with an era, such as CE or BCE. This may be useful if you are formatting dates from very long ago or if you are using a Japanese calendar. Legal values are &quot;long&quot;, &quot;short&quot;, and &quot;narrow&quot;.</p>

<p>hour, minute, second<br/>
These properties specify how you would like time displayed. Use &quot;numeric&quot; for a one- or two-digit field or &quot;2-digit&quot; to force single-digit numbers to be padded on the left with a 0.</p>

<p>timeZone<br/>
This property specifies the desired time zone for which the date should be formatted. If omitted, the local time zone is used. Implementations always recognize “UTC” and may also recognize Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) time zone names, such as “America/Los_Angeles”.</p>

<p>timeZoneName<br/>
This property specifies how the time zone should be displayed in a formatted date or time. Use &quot;long&quot; for a fully spelled-out time zone name and &quot;short&quot; for an abbreviated or numeric time zone.</p>

<p>hour12<br/>
This boolean property specifies whether or not to use 12-hour time. The default is locale dependent, but you can override it with this property.</p>

<p>hourCycle<br/>
This property allows you to specify whether midnight is written as 0 hours, 12 hours, or 24 hours. The default is locale dependent, but you can override the default with this property. Note that hour12 takes precedence over this property. Use the value &quot;h11&quot; to specify that midnight is 0 and the hour before midnight is 11pm. Use &quot;h12&quot; to specify that midnight is 12. Use &quot;h23&quot; to specify that midnight is 0 and the hour before midnight is 23. And use &quot;h24&quot; to specify that midnight is 24.</p>

<p>Here are some examples:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">let d = new Date(&quot;2020-01-02T13:14:15Z&quot;);  // January 2nd, 2020, 13:14:15 UTC

// With no options, we get a basic numeric date format
Intl.DateTimeFormat(&quot;en-US&quot;).format(d) // =&gt; &quot;1/2/2020&quot;
Intl.DateTimeFormat(&quot;fr-FR&quot;).format(d) // =&gt; &quot;02/01/2020&quot;

// Spelled out weekday and month
let opts = { weekday: &quot;long&quot;, month: &quot;long&quot;, year: &quot;numeric&quot;, day: &quot;numeric&quot; };
Intl.DateTimeFormat(&quot;en-US&quot;, opts).format(d) // =&gt; &quot;Thursday, January 2, 2020&quot;
Intl.DateTimeFormat(&quot;es-ES&quot;, opts).format(d) // =&gt; &quot;jueves, 2 de enero de 2020&quot;

// The time in New York, for a French-speaking Canadian
opts = { hour: &quot;numeric&quot;, minute: &quot;2-digit&quot;, timeZone: &quot;America/New_York&quot; };
Intl.DateTimeFormat(&quot;fr-CA&quot;, opts).format(d) // =&gt; &quot;8 h 14&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>Intl.DateTimeFormat can display dates using calendars other than the default Julian calendar based on the Christian era. Although some locales may use a non-Christian calendar by default, you can always explicitly specify the calendar to use by adding -u-ca- to the locale and following that with the name of the calendar. Possible calendar names include “buddhist”, “chinese”, “coptic”, “ethiopic”, “gregory”, “hebrew”, “indian”, “islamic”, “iso8601”, “japanese”, and “persian”. Continuing the preceding example, we can determine the year in various non-Christian calendars:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">let opts = { year: &quot;numeric&quot;, era: &quot;short&quot; };
Intl.DateTimeFormat(&quot;en&quot;, opts).format(d)                // =&gt; &quot;2020 AD&quot;
Intl.DateTimeFormat(&quot;en-u-ca-iso8601&quot;, opts).format(d)   // =&gt; &quot;2020 AD&quot;
Intl.DateTimeFormat(&quot;en-u-ca-hebrew&quot;, opts).format(d)    // =&gt; &quot;5780 AM&quot;
Intl.DateTimeFormat(&quot;en-u-ca-buddhist&quot;, opts).format(d)  // =&gt; &quot;2563 BE&quot;
Intl.DateTimeFormat(&quot;en-u-ca-islamic&quot;, opts).format(d)   // =&gt; &quot;1441 AH&quot;
Intl.DateTimeFormat(&quot;en-u-ca-persian&quot;, opts).format(d)   // =&gt; &quot;1398 AP&quot;
Intl.DateTimeFormat(&quot;en-u-ca-indian&quot;, opts).format(d)    // =&gt; &quot;1941 Saka&quot;
Intl.DateTimeFormat(&quot;en-u-ca-chinese&quot;, opts).format(d)   // =&gt; &quot;36 78&quot;
Intl.DateTimeFormat(&quot;en-u-ca-japanese&quot;, opts).format(d)  // =&gt; &quot;2 Reiwa&quot;
</code></pre>

<h3 id="toc_32">11.7.3 Comparing Strings</h3>

<p>The problem of sorting strings into alphabetical order (or some more general “collation order” for nonalphabetical scripts) is more challenging than English speakers often realize. English uses a relatively small alphabet with no accented letters, and we have the benefit of a character encoding (ASCII, since incorporated into Unicode) whose numerical values perfectly match our standard string sort order. Things are not so simple in other languages. Spanish, for example treats ñ as a distinct letter that comes after n and before o. Lithuanian alphabetizes Y before J, and Welsh treats digraphs like CH and DD as single letters with CH coming after C and DD sorting after D.</p>

<p>If you want to display strings to a user in an order that they will find natural, it is not enough use the sort() method on an array of strings. But if you create an Intl.Collator object, you can pass the compare() method of that object to the sort() method to perform locale-appropriate sorting of the strings. Intl.Collator objects can be configured so that the compare() method performs case-insensitive comparisons or even comparisons that only consider the base letter and ignore accents and other diacritics.</p>

<p>Like Intl.NumberFormat() and Intl.DateTimeFormat(), the Intl.Collator() constructor takes two arguments. The first specifies a locale or an array of locales, and the second is an optional object whose properties specify exactly what kind of string comparison is to be done. The supported properties are these:</p>

<p>usage<br/>
This property specifies how the collator object is to be used. The default value is &quot;sort&quot;, but you can also specify &quot;search&quot;. The idea is that, when sorting strings, you typically want a collator that differentiates as many strings as possible to produce a reliable ordering. But when comparing two strings, some locales may want a less strict comparison that ignores accents, for example.</p>

<p>sensitivity<br/>
This property specifies whether the collator is sensitive to letter case and accents when comparing strings. The value &quot;base&quot; causes comparisons that ignore case and accents, considering only the base letter for each character. (Note, however, that some languages consider certain accented characters to be distinct base letters.) &quot;accent&quot; considers accents in comparisons but ignores case. &quot;case&quot; considers case and ignores accents. And &quot;variant&quot; performs strict comparisons that consider both case and accents. The default value for this property is &quot;variant&quot; when usage is &quot;sort&quot;. If usage is &quot;search&quot;, then the default sensitivity depends on the locale.</p>

<p>ignorePunctuation<br/>
Set this property to true to ignore spaces and punctuation when comparing strings. With this property set to true, the strings “any one” and “anyone”, for example, will be considered equal.</p>

<p>numeric<br/>
Set this property to true if the strings you are comparing are integers or contain integers and you want them to be sorted into numerical order instead of alphabetical order. With this option set, the string “Version 9” will be sorted before “Version 10”, for example.</p>

<p>caseFirst<br/>
This property specifies which letter case should come first. If you specify &quot;upper&quot;, then “A” will sort before “a”. And if you specify &quot;lower&quot;, then “a” will sort before “A”. In either case, note that the upper- and lowercase variants of the same letter will be next to one another in sort order, which is different than Unicode lexicographic ordering (the default behavior of the Array sort() method) in which all ASCII uppercase letters come before all ASCII lowercase letters. The default for this property is locale dependent, and implementations may ignore this property and not allow you to override the case sort order.</p>

<p>Once you have created an Intl.Collator object for the desired locale and options, you can use its compare() method to compare two strings. This method returns a number. If the returned value is less than zero, then the first string comes before the second string. If it is greater than zero, then the first string comes after the second string. And if compare() returns zero, then the two strings are equal as far as this collator is concerned.</p>

<p>This compare() method that takes two strings and returns a number less than, equal to, or greater than zero is exactly what the Array sort() method expects for its optional argument. Also, Intl.Collator automatically binds the compare() method to its instance, so you can pass it directly to sort() without having to write a wrapper function and invoke it through the collator object. Here are some examples:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">// A basic comparator for sorting in the user&#39;s locale.
// Never sort human-readable strings without passing something like this:
const collator = new Intl.Collator().compare;
[&quot;a&quot;, &quot;z&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;Z&quot;].sort(collator)      // =&gt; [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;z&quot;, &quot;Z&quot;]

// Filenames often include numbers, so we should sort those specially
const filenameOrder = new Intl.Collator(undefined, { numeric: true }).compare;
[&quot;page10&quot;, &quot;page9&quot;].sort(filenameOrder)  // =&gt; [&quot;page9&quot;, &quot;page10&quot;]

// Find all strings that loosely match a target string
const fuzzyMatcher = new Intl.Collator(undefined, {
    sensitivity: &quot;base&quot;,
    ignorePunctuation: true
}).compare;
let strings = [&quot;food&quot;, &quot;fool&quot;, &quot;Føø Bar&quot;];
strings.findIndex(s =&gt; fuzzyMatcher(s, &quot;foobar&quot;) === 0)  // =&gt; 2
</code></pre>

<p>Some locales have more than one possible collation order. In Germany, for example, phone books use a slightly more phonetic sort order than dictionaries do. In Spain, before 1994, “ch” and “ll” were treated as separate letters, so that country now has a modern sort order and a traditional sort order. And in China, collation order can be based on character encodings, the base radical and strokes of each character, or on the Pinyin romanization of characters. These collation variants cannot be selected through the Intl.Collator options argument, but they can be selected by adding -u-co- to the locale string and adding the name of the desired variant. Use &quot;de-DE-u-co-phonebk&quot; for phone book ordering in Germany, for example, and &quot;zh-TW-u-co-pinyin&quot; for Pinyin ordering in Taiwan.</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">// Before 1994, CH and LL were treated as separate letters in Spain
const modernSpanish = Intl.Collator(&quot;es-ES&quot;).compare;
const traditionalSpanish = Intl.Collator(&quot;es-ES-u-co-trad&quot;).compare;
let palabras = [&quot;luz&quot;, &quot;llama&quot;, &quot;como&quot;, &quot;chico&quot;];
palabras.sort(modernSpanish)      // =&gt; [&quot;chico&quot;, &quot;como&quot;, &quot;llama&quot;, &quot;luz&quot;]
palabras.sort(traditionalSpanish) // =&gt; [&quot;como&quot;, &quot;chico&quot;, &quot;luz&quot;, &quot;llama&quot;]
</code></pre>

<h2 id="toc_33">11.8 The Console API</h2>

<p>You’ve seen the console.log() function used throughout this book: in web browsers, it prints a string in the “Console” tab of the browser’s developer tools pane, which can be very helpful when debugging. In Node, console.log() is a general-purpose output function and prints its arguments to the process’s stdout stream, where it typically appears to the user in a terminal window as program output.</p>

<p>The Console API defines a number of useful functions in addition to console.log(). The API is not part of any ECMAScript standard, but it is supported by browsers and by Node and has been formally written up and standardized at <a href="https://console.spec.whatwg.org">https://console.spec.whatwg.org</a>.</p>

<p>The Console API defines the following functions:</p>

<p>console.log()<br/>
This is the most well-known of the console functions. It converts its arguments to strings and outputs them to the console. It includes spaces between the arguments and starts a new line after outputting all arguments.</p>

<p>console.debug(), console.info(), console.warn(), console.error()<br/>
These functions are almost identical to console.log(). In Node, console.error() sends its output to the stderr stream rather than the stdout stream, but the other functions are aliases of console.log(). In browsers, output messages generated by each of these functions may be prefixed by an icon that indicates its level or severity, and the developer console may also allow developers to filter console messages by level.</p>

<p>console.assert()<br/>
If the first argument is truthy (i.e., if the assertion passes), then this function does nothing. But if the first argument is false or another falsy value, then the remaining arguments are printed as if they had been passed to console.error() with an “Assertion failed” prefix. Note that, unlike typical assert() functions, console.assert() does not throw an exception when an assertion fails.</p>

<p>console.clear()<br/>
This function clears the console when that is possible. This works in browsers and in Node when Node is displaying its output to a terminal. If Node’s output has been redirected to a file or a pipe, however, then calling this function has no effect.</p>

<p>console.table()<br/>
This function is a remarkably powerful but little-known feature for producing tabular output, and it is particularly useful in Node programs that need to produce output that summarizes data. console.table() attempts to display its argument in tabular form (although, if it can’t do that, it displays it using regular console.log() formatting). This works best when the argument is a relatively short array of objects, and all of the objects in the array have the same (relatively small) set of properties. In this case, each object in the array is formatted as a row of the table, and each property is a column of the table. You can also pass an array of property names as an optional second argument to specify the desired set of columns. If you pass an object instead of an array of objects, then the output will be a table with one column for property names and one column for property values. Or, if those property values are themselves objects, their property names will become columns in the table.</p>

<p>console.trace()<br/>
This function logs its arguments like console.log() does, and, in addition, follows its output with a stack trace. In Node, the output goes to stderr instead of stdout.</p>

<p>console.count()<br/>
This function takes a string argument and logs that string, followed by the number of times it has been called with that string. This can be useful when debugging an event handler, for example, if you need to keep track of how many times the event handler has been triggered.</p>

<p>console.countReset()<br/>
This function takes a string argument and resets the counter for that string.</p>

<p>console.group()<br/>
This function prints its arguments to the console as if they had been passed to console.log(), then sets the internal state of the console so that all subsequent console messages (until the next console.groupEnd() call) will be indented relative to the message that it just printed. This allows a group of related messages to be visually grouped with indentation. In web browsers, the developer console typically allows grouped messages to be collapsed and expanded as a group. The arguments to console.group() are typically used to provide an explanatory name for the group.</p>

<p>console.groupCollapsed()<br/>
This function works like console.group() except that in web browsers, the group will be “collapsed” by default and the messages it contains will be hidden unless the user clicks to expand the group. In Node, this function is a synonym for console.group().</p>

<p>console.groupEnd()<br/>
This function takes no arguments. It produces no output of its own but ends the indentation and grouping caused by the most recent call to console.group() or console.groupCollapsed().</p>

<p>console.time()<br/>
This function takes a single string argument, makes a note of the time it was called with that string, and produces no output.</p>

<p>console.timeLog()<br/>
This function takes a string as its first argument. If that string had previously been passed to console.time(), then it prints that string followed by the elapsed time since the console.time() call. If there are any additional arguments to console.timeLog(), they are printed as if they had been passed to console.log().</p>

<p>console.timeEnd()<br/>
This function takes a single string argument. If that argument had previously been passed to console.time(), then it prints that argument and the elapsed time. After calling console.timeEnd(), it is no longer legal to call console.timeLog() without first calling console.time() again.</p>

<h3 id="toc_34">11.8.1 Formatted Output with Console</h3>

<p>Console functions that print their arguments like console.log() have a little-known feature: if the first argument is a string that includes %s, %i, %d, %f, %o, %O, or %c, then this first argument is treated as format string,6 and the values of subsequent arguments are substituted into the string in place of the two-character % sequences.</p>

<p>The meanings of the sequences are as follows:</p>

<p>%s<br/>
The argument is converted to a string.</p>

<p>%i and %d<br/>
The argument is converted to a number and then truncated to an integer.</p>

<p>%f<br/>
The argument is converted to a number</p>

<p>%o and %O<br/>
The argument is treated as an object, and property names and values are displayed. (In web browsers, this display is typically interactive, and users can expand and collapse properties to explore a nested data structure.) %o and %O both display object details. The uppercase variant uses an implementation-dependent output format that is judged to be most useful for software developers.</p>

<p>%c<br/>
In web browsers, the argument is interpreted as a string of CSS styles and used to style any text that follows (until the next %c sequence or the end of the string). In Node, the %c sequence and its corresponding argument are simply ignored.</p>

<p>Note that it is not often necessary to use a format string with the console functions: it is usually easy to obtain suitable output by simply passing one or more values (including objects) to the function and allowing the implementation to display them in a useful way. As an example, note that, if you pass an Error object to console.log(), it is automatically printed along with its stack trace.</p>

<h2 id="toc_35">11.9 URL APIs</h2>

<p>Since JavaScript is so commonly used in web browsers and web servers, it is common for JavaScript code to need to manipulate URLs. The URL class parses URLs and also allows modification (adding search parameters or altering paths, for example) of existing URLs. It also properly handles the complicated topic of escaping and unescaping the various components of a URL.</p>

<p>The URL class is not part of any ECMAScript standard, but it works in Node and all internet browsers other than Internet Explorer. It is standardized at <a href="https://url.spec.whatwg.org">https://url.spec.whatwg.org</a>.</p>

<p>Create a URL object with the URL() constructor, passing an absolute URL string as the argument. Or pass a relative URL as the first argument and the absolute URL that it is relative to as the second argument. Once you have created the URL object, its various properties allow you to query unescaped versions of the various parts of the URL:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">let url = new URL(&quot;https://example.com:8000/path/name?q=term#fragment&quot;);
url.href        // =&gt; &quot;https://example.com:8000/path/name?q=term#fragment&quot;
url.origin      // =&gt; &quot;https://example.com:8000&quot;
url.protocol    // =&gt; &quot;https:&quot;
url.host        // =&gt; &quot;example.com:8000&quot;
url.hostname    // =&gt; &quot;example.com&quot;
url.port        // =&gt; &quot;8000&quot;
url.pathname    // =&gt; &quot;/path/name&quot;
url.search      // =&gt; &quot;?q=term&quot;
url.hash        // =&gt; &quot;#fragment&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>Although it is not commonly used, URLs can include a username or a username and password, and the URL class can parse these URL components, too:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">let url = new URL(&quot;ftp://admin:1337!@ftp.example.com/&quot;);
url.href       // =&gt; &quot;ftp://admin:1337!@ftp.example.com/&quot;
url.origin     // =&gt; &quot;ftp://ftp.example.com&quot;
url.username   // =&gt; &quot;admin&quot;
url.password   // =&gt; &quot;1337!&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>The origin property here is a simple combination of the URL protocol and host (including the port if one is specified). As such, it is a read-only property. But each of the other properties demonstrated in the previous example is read/write: you can set any of these properties to set the corresponding part of the URL:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">let url = new URL(&quot;https://example.com&quot;);  // Start with our server
url.pathname = &quot;api/search&quot;;               // Add a path to an API endpoint
url.search = &quot;q=test&quot;;                     // Add a query parameter
url.toString()  // =&gt; &quot;https://example.com/api/search?q=test&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>One of the important features of the URL class is that it correctly adds punctuation and escapes special characters in URLs when that is needed:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">let url = new URL(&quot;https://example.com&quot;);
url.pathname = &quot;path with spaces&quot;;
url.search = &quot;q=foo#bar&quot;;
url.pathname  // =&gt; &quot;/path%20with%20spaces&quot;
url.search    // =&gt; &quot;?q=foo%23bar&quot;
url.href      // =&gt; &quot;https://example.com/path%20with%20spaces?q=foo%23bar&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>The href property in these examples is a special one: reading href is equivalent to calling toString(): it reassembles all parts of the URL into the canonical string form of the URL. And setting href to a new string reruns the URL parser on the new string as if you had called the URL() constructor again.</p>

<p>In the previous examples, we’ve been using the search property to refer to the entire query portion of a URL, which consists of the characters from a question mark to the end of the URL or to the first hash character. Sometimes, it is sufficient to just treat this as a single URL property. Often, however, HTTP requests encode the values of multiple form fields or multiple API parameters into the query portion of a URL using the application/x-www-form-urlencoded format. In this format, the query portion of the URL is a question mark followed by one or more name/value pairs, which are separated from one another by ampersands. The same name can appear more than once, resulting in a named search parameter with more than one value.</p>

<p>If you want to encode these kinds of name/value pairs into the query portion of a URL, then the searchParams property will be more useful than the search property. The search property is a read/write string that lets you get and set the entire query portion of the URL. The searchParams property is a read-only reference to a URLSearchParams object, which has an API for getting, setting, adding, deleting, and sorting the parameters encoded into the query portion of the URL:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">let url = new URL(&quot;https://example.com/search&quot;);
url.search                            // =&gt; &quot;&quot;: no query yet
url.searchParams.append(&quot;q&quot;, &quot;term&quot;); // Add a search parameter
url.search                            // =&gt; &quot;?q=term&quot;
url.searchParams.set(&quot;q&quot;, &quot;x&quot;);       // Change the value of this parameter
url.search                            // =&gt; &quot;?q=x&quot;
url.searchParams.get(&quot;q&quot;)             // =&gt; &quot;x&quot;: query the parameter value
url.searchParams.has(&quot;q&quot;)             // =&gt; true: there is a q parameter
url.searchParams.has(&quot;p&quot;)             // =&gt; false: there is no p parameter
url.searchParams.append(&quot;opts&quot;, &quot;1&quot;); // Add another search parameter
url.search                            // =&gt; &quot;?q=x&amp;opts=1&quot;
url.searchParams.append(&quot;opts&quot;, &quot;&amp;&quot;); // Add another value for same name
url.search                            // =&gt; &quot;?q=x&amp;opts=1&amp;opts=%26&quot;: note escape
url.searchParams.get(&quot;opts&quot;)          // =&gt; &quot;1&quot;: the first value
url.searchParams.getAll(&quot;opts&quot;)       // =&gt; [&quot;1&quot;, &quot;&amp;&quot;]: all values
url.searchParams.sort();              // Put params in alphabetical order
url.search                            // =&gt; &quot;?opts=1&amp;opts=%26&amp;q=x&quot;
url.searchParams.set(&quot;opts&quot;, &quot;y&quot;);    // Change the opts param
url.search                            // =&gt; &quot;?opts=y&amp;q=x&quot;
// searchParams is iterable
[...url.searchParams]                 // =&gt; [[&quot;opts&quot;, &quot;y&quot;], [&quot;q&quot;, &quot;x&quot;]]
url.searchParams.delete(&quot;opts&quot;);      // Delete the opts param
url.search                            // =&gt; &quot;?q=x&quot;
url.href                              // =&gt; &quot;https://example.com/search?q=x&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>The value of the searchParams property is a URLSearchParams object. If you want to encode URL parameters into a query string, you can create a URLSearchParams object, append parameters, then convert it to a string and set it on the search property of a URL:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">let url = new URL(&quot;http://example.com&quot;);
let params = new URLSearchParams();
params.append(&quot;q&quot;, &quot;term&quot;);
params.append(&quot;opts&quot;, &quot;exact&quot;);
params.toString()               // =&gt; &quot;q=term&amp;opts=exact&quot;
url.search = params;
url.href                        // =&gt; &quot;http://example.com/?q=term&amp;opts=exact&quot;
</code></pre>

<h3 id="toc_36">11.9.1 Legacy URL Functions</h3>

<p>Prior to the definition of the URL API described previously, there have been multiple attempts to support URL escaping and unescaping in the core JavaScript language. The first attempt was the globally defined escape() and unescape() functions, which are now deprecated but still widely implemented. They should not be used.</p>

<p>When escape() and unescape() were deprecated, ECMAScript introduced two pairs of alternative global functions:</p>

<p>encodeURI() and decodeURI()<br/>
encodeURI() takes a string as its argument and returns a new string in which non-ASCII characters plus certain ASCII characters (such as space) are escaped. decodeURI() reverses the process. Characters that need to be escaped are first converted to their UTF-8 encoding, then each byte of that encoding is replaced with a %xx escape sequence, where xx is two hexadecimal digits. Because encodeURI() is intended for encoding entire URLs, it does not escape URL separator characters such as /, ?, and #. But this means that encodeURI() cannot work correctly for URLs that have those characters within their various components.</p>

<p>encodeURIComponent() and decodeURIComponent()<br/>
This pair of functions works just like encodeURI() and decodeURI() except that they are intended to escape individual components of a URI, so they also escape characters like /, ?, and # that are used to separate those components. These are the most useful of the legacy URL functions, but be aware that encodeURIComponent() will escape / characters in a path name that you probably do not want escaped. And it will convert spaces in a query parameter to %20, even though spaces are supposed to be escaped with a + in that portion of a URL.</p>

<p>The fundamental problem with all of these legacy functions is that they seek to apply a single encoding scheme to all parts of a URL when the fact is that different portions of a URL use different encodings. If you want a properly formatted and encoded URL, the solution is simply to use the URL class for all URL manipulation you do.</p>

<h2 id="toc_37">11.10 Timers</h2>

<p>Since the earliest days of JavaScript, web browsers have defined two functions—setTimeout() and setInterval()—that allow programs to ask the browser to invoke a function after a specified amount of time has elapsed or to invoke the function repeatedly at a specified interval. These functions have never been standardized as part of the core language, but they work in all browsers and in Node and are a de facto part of the JavaScript standard library.</p>

<p>The first argument to setTimeout() is a function, and the second argument is a number that specifies how many milliseconds should elapse before the function is invoked. After the specified amount of time (and maybe a little longer if the system is busy), the function will be invoked with no arguments. Here, for example, are three setTimeout() calls that print console messages after one second, two seconds, and three seconds:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">setTimeout(() =&gt; { console.log(&quot;Ready...&quot;); }, 1000);
setTimeout(() =&gt; { console.log(&quot;set...&quot;); }, 2000);
setTimeout(() =&gt; { console.log(&quot;go!&quot;); }, 3000);
</code></pre>

<p>Note that setTimeout() does not wait for the time to elapse before returning. All three lines of code in this example run almost instantly, but then nothing happens until 1,000 milliseconds elapse.</p>

<p>If you omit the second argument to setTimeout(), it defaults to 0. That does not mean, however, that the function you specify is invoked immediately. Instead, the function is registered to be called “as soon as possible.” If a browser is particularly busy handling user input or other events, it may take 10 milliseconds or more before the function is invoked.</p>

<p>setTimeout() registers a function to be invoked once. Sometimes, that function will itself call setTimeout() to schedule another invocation at a future time. If you want to invoke a function repeatedly, however, it is often simpler to use setInterval(). setInterval() takes the same two arguments as setTimeout() but invokes the function repeatedly every time the specified number of milliseconds (approximately) have elapsed.</p>

<p>Both setTimeout() and setInterval() return a value. If you save this value in a variable, you can then use it later to cancel the execution of the function by passing it to clearTimeout() or clearInterval(). The returned value is typically a number in web browsers and is an object in Node. The actual type doesn’t matter, and you should treat it as an opaque value. The only thing you can do with this value is pass it to clearTimeout() to cancel the execution of a function registered with setTimeout() (assuming it hasn’t been invoked yet) or to stop the repeating execution of a function registered with setInterval().</p>

<p>Here is an example that demonstrates the use of setTimeout(), setInterval(), and clearInterval() to display a simple digital clock with the Console API:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">// Once a second: clear the console and print the current time
let clock = setInterval(() =&gt; {
    console.clear();
    console.log(new Date().toLocaleTimeString());
}, 1000);

// After 10 seconds: stop the repeating code above.
setTimeout(() =&gt; { clearInterval(clock); }, 10000);
We’ll see setTimeout() and setInterval() again when we cover asynchronous programming in Chapter 13.
</code></pre>

<h2 id="toc_38">11.11 Summary</h2>

<p>Learning a programming language is not just about mastering the grammar. It is equally important to study the standard library so that you are familiar with all the tools that are shipped with the language. This chapter has documented JavaScript’s standard library, which includes:</p>

<p>Important data structures, such as Set, Map, and typed arrays.</p>

<p>The Date and URL classes for working with dates and URLs.</p>

<p>JavaScript’s regular expression grammar and its RegExp class for textual pattern matching.</p>

<p>JavaScript’s internationalization library for formatting dates, time, and numbers and for sorting strings.</p>

<p>The JSON object for serializing and deserializing simple data structures and the console object for logging messages.</p>

<hr/>

<ol>
<li>This predictable iteration order is another thing about JavaScript sets that Python programmers may find surprising.</li>
<li>Typed arrays were first introduced to client-side JavaScript when web browsers added support for WebGL graphics. What is new in ES6 is that they have been elevated to a core language feature.</li>
<li>Except within a character class (square brackets), where \b matches the backspace character.</li>
<li>Parsing URLs with regular expressions is not a good idea. See §11.9 for a more robust URL parser.</li>
<li>C programmers will recognize many of these character sequences from the printf() function.</li>
